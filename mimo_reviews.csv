A Google user,5,very easy to navigate so far

A Google user,5,I'm enjoying this so far.
A Google user,3,great app

A Google user,4,May make tasks faster

A Google user,5,it's very nice and very useful for me 😊😊
A Google user,4,"Its a good appo to progress with any programming language. But it is not organised properly, and still requires a lot of bug fixing. For example, while learning something we often get skipped from step1 to step4. As a result we don't know whats in between (step2&step3). This leads to a confusion."
A Google user,4,Just started
A Google user,5,it's nice for beginners to learn python. I suggest everyone to use this app. I like it ☺️.
A Google user,3,it is very useful app and it has noporblem
A Google user,5,This 1st session has been enjoyable.
A Google user,4,"Mimo is great for learning code, but what I don't like is you have to spend coins just to get hearts back. So if you get 5 questions wrong you have to spend coins and if your out. Your done for the amount of hours until it gives you more hearts. Overall it's a pretty good app for beginners."
A Google user,5,"Please add courses related to finance power Bi and Excel, etc Otherwise, it's a great app for learning coding"

A Google user,5,This is the best coding app i have ever used. Very less ads. More knowledge. This is worth it!
A Google user,2,It requires hearts to continue progress or we need to buy the subscription. This restricts and makes you lose interest in the course.
A Google user,5,Great 👌 lessons
A Google user,2,the try max for free is not clickable
A Google user,5,WOW I'm 38 and have never coded in my life! I feel very confident that I will be coding within a month or less!
A Google user,5,love how it's free and I'm okay to watch an add or two plus it has the perfect amount of lives and doesn't. move too fast

A Google user,1,In Iran we can't use it.
A Google user,4,very good app for learning
A Google user,5,it's fun and easy
A Google user,5,"need code, eat code, dream code, love code"
A Google user,1,It's just one long ad.
A Google user,1,"I want to opt out from a leader board - if you add this feature - I'll give you 5 star. Also it's not possible to change email address of your account. Competition is a thief of joy. I'm also perfectionist. If I'm competing I want to be number 1, always. Bronze medal or silver medal is a humiliation for me. I want to learn at my own pace. When I do tasks a little harder, I'm accidentally shooting up on the leader board. I don't want to compete"
A Google user,3,"Previously I was using the app to learn Front End and it was great, but now I redownloaded to learn Python and have no way to find any button to change the path, it only allows me to continue with the front end path. Please fix it otherwise it's not useful for me anymore."
A Google user,5,its great way to learn with fun.... prefer mimo now instead of instgram

A Google user,5,Great App for learning and very helpful.
A Google user,5,This Is the best app
A Google user,5,I think this is fun and creative and ez way to learn code
A Google user,5,"I got a degree in this a while ago but haven't been practicing enough... this is great as a reminder, and super simple to start. I haven't paid into it at all yet"

A Google user,5,"It is a very good app for coding . It lets you select what you like or what you want to do after so many choices , it suggest you which course is best for you accordingly to your interest. There are literally so many options you can go for. Just an amazing app. You can also choose the other courses if yours is complete ✅ and give you a amazing certificate to make your resume more powerful."
A Google user,5,FROM THE FIRST DAY I STARTED USING IT FOR LIKE 30 MIN/EACH DAY AND NOW I AM PROGRESSING AT A FAST PACE. THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS APP IS THAT WE CAN CHECK OUR PROGRESS AND EXPLORE THE CODING WE ALREADY DID. BTW IT WOULD BE MORE GOOD IF THERE WAS NO HEART SYSTEM WHICH LETS YOU DO MISTAKE ONLY 5 TIMES AND THEN FORCES YOU TO TAKE A BREAK. :)
A Google user,3,"Lost interest before the second lesson. May be great, but it's boring."
A Google user,5,Awesome! Easy to understand and there's practice right after. Love it!
A Google user,1,February 2024: The the streak lossbug is still present November 2024: This bug is still present. There's no proper support. There's a percisting bug where the daily streak is added but then ot is not properly registered into the database. I lost 250 days streak because of this and I'm not coming back! This is a developer training app full of bugs for petes sake! And don't you mention streak repair once a month when the bug happens two days in a row! I want my money back but there's no support.
A Google user,5,it's very amazing 🤩...
A Google user,5,great app to learn code!
A Google user,5,Very great!
A Google user,4,good
A Google user,5,One of my favorite learning methods I've ever found ever!!! It's like duolingo but for learning programming.

A Google user,3,I am still studying but it's amazing
A Google user,4,user friendly and educative
A Google user,5,"This app makes learning code understandable and fun. So far, so good."
A Google user,4,"This is a wonderful app for learning and practicing coding. It will be helpful if you add some other programming languages like java , c++, swift etc and also add some more new features in regarding practice problems and filling the hearts."
A Google user,5,"If there were more stars to rate this app, I'd add them all. Exceptional learning tool. ❤️"
A Google user,5,A great learning tool.
A Google user,5,It's the best app I can find for coding. And it's amazing y'all should try it
A Google user,5,"Great app 👌, it makes it easy to understand the concepts."
A Google user,5,"I had a good experience. It's easy to use, learn and understand concepts"
A Google user,5,"haven't actually used it yet, it, in a real easy, simple way,(and I'm a big dummy when it comes to this computer type of stuff LOL) teaches you how to use it , by teaching you variables etc. etc. I may change my stars when I get into the app and actually use it but so far so good and I hope I don't have to"
A Google user,5,it is nice app
A Google user,5,Best app ever
A Google user,5,The app's theme and presentation is so cool and it seems that the developers of this app are well experienced. They know how can the things looks easy for beginners. That's great!
A Google user,5,excellent
A Google user,5,"this is quite engagement and fun to learn with, lots of love mimo team , U guys did wonders , is so easy to understand"
A Google user,4,You guys should consider giving pionts for a reviewed lesson... Also I didn't get my free mimo pro after I invited someone...
A Google user,5,we learn a lot of things in this application
A Google user,5,good
A Google user,5,"I'm learning python on it and it's truly good and easy to understand ,if your a bignner just like then this app is perfect for you"
A Google user,5,very interesting to learn with
A Google user,1,"Mimo is a great tool for absolute beginners. I downloaded it for the clear roadmap (as advertised), but I was disappointed when I ended up with only basic lessons even though I selected that I knew a lot, yet the app forced me to start from scratch. Perhaps, a diagnostic test to place users at the right level would be very helpful."
A Google user,5,I am learning a lot from this app....I definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to do coding(currently I'm learning Python)
A Google user,5,veryy nice
A Google user,5,This is great. The way the lessons are setup is fantastic. How I wish I had known this app for long. And thank you for making it free.
A Google user,4,good app
A Google user,5,Very interesting and easy to learn love it

A Google user,5,No ads its just teach you and nothing else in between
A Google user,5,"So far, I like this App. Helping me to learn coding in easy way and also fun."
A Google user,1,It's too difficult to learn. Like actually.
A Google user,4,User friendly and very helpful in learning how to code
A Google user,5,great application it teaches of coding things for free I thank you for such an app
A Google user,5,best learning app
A Google user,5,"Very, very great app. Try it out, u will never regret it ✌️😉😁😁😁🥰"
A Google user,5,"Really helpful app. I'm loving it, keep up the good work"
A Google user,5,Great app and totally free best for beginners and very well explained
A Google user,1,"I promise I will give it a try, but the format makes it REALLY hard to get motivated. I don't want Duo Lingo style fill in the blank. It requires no effort or thought, and teachers nothing."
A Google user,5,I'm having a blast on this
A Google user,5,I really love this app
A Google user,4,"I don't like the color of python code in practice, the previous one were better and helpful the track the code syntax,"
A Google user,3,it's good but for fun of course
A Google user,5,very nice app
A Google user,5,Nice app
A Google user,5,"am just happy and overwhelming, this app just give me hope and courage to continue my coding practice. God bless you guys."
A Google user,3,"I actually really like this app! I learn quickly, it's addicting and fun! However, I wish they changed some stuff in the mobile app, specifically the code editor. If I hold in the ""delete"" key on my phone-keyboard in their code editor, it will suddenly hop to the top of the file after 3-15 letters have been deleted. This drives me insane!! I also wish I could have the option to tap on a certain location in the code without selecting a block of code, because it makes it so hard to code on mobile."
A Google user,5,"Good platform for Beginners like myself, to learn from scratch 👍. Highly recommend"
A Google user,4,"good,🤩🙈 i can't deny it"
A Google user,5,so far this simple and fun to use
A Google user,5,I usually don't write reviews but this is the best application i have came across so far. It's easy to learn from basics to adavanced.
A Google user,5,learning well and i am loving the simplifying
A Google user,5,its an app that is helpful for begginers specially if your new to coding. I definitely 100% recommend this if you want to learn coding. hope it helps..
A Google user,5,I'm enjoying learning with Mimo App
A Google user,5,good app
A Google user,4,usefull
A Google user,5,"Mimo helps me to learn coding. It teaches us in a smooth way. There is also a leaderboard which helps me to compete against others. It teaches like Duolingo. There are many levels and by completing those levels, I am learning coding day by day."
A Google user,5,In each course It provides bite sized lessons that are reinforced by micro tests for the content. I've only used it for about 30 minutes but I have a good understanding on HTML. I believe my existing experience in python and UE5 blueprints make it easier to understand the coding concepts now and in the future.
A Google user,5,"ads suck but they're only 10 seconds, this app is teaching me better than my college professor"
A Google user,4,great 👍
A Google user,3,"Gotta dock this at least 2 stars if only because they don't have the text input figured out yet. Constantly have to go back and re-enter code because it errors. Hitting 'space' either doesn't work, or it replaces the last character with a period. Or mid-typing the cursor will randomly go back to the beginning and start typing in front of code you already entered. I wouldn't pay for this app until they get that fixed. Too disruptive to the lessons to justify paying for it."
A Google user,4,"I wìll never regret downloading this app, I mean it's enjoyable beyond learning."
A Google user,5,"it gives amazing questions, you should try it."
A Google user,1,It kept glitching in the middle of my animation
A Google user,5,very cool 😎

A Google user,3,"i cant use the web anymore and i cant contact support for this, i have an active subscription and its telling me to subscribe again just to use it on the web. why?"
A Google user,5,It teaches you to step-by-step.It helps you correct your mistakes So I recommend this for all coders.And Soon to Be coders
A Google user,5,It's certainly the best I've seen....it has practical section where you will implement what you've just been taught... I love this app but I pray it doesn't stop me half way or somewhere very important cos I want to learn till the end of my course. Thank you Mimo
A Google user,5,"I'm having a good time learning with Mimo, it is very useful to briefly have lessons when you don't have too much time!!"
A Google user,5,"This app is incredible for beginners. But if Mimo learn team is looking at this, ONE REQUEST, it would be nice to add C++, C, and C# as their needed for my academics"

A Google user,1,"What type of app is this, that went on to deduct your money even after stopping the trial before the due date. And the most painful part is that even afterward you can't even access the app"
A Google user,5,it's kinda fun I like it
A Google user,4,gold
A Google user,5,"Fun way to learn coding. Honestly, the user interface is smooth and clean."
A Google user,5,Great for new learners and also great for a refresher
A Google user,5,great
A Google user,4,It's actually not a scam as I thought at first when I saw it in TikTok. It's pretty fun too and you actually learn stuff. It's basically Duolingo but for coding. If you're interested in coding then you should definitely try it out.
A Google user,3,"I just wanted to learn some javascript, but it forced me to do basic html and css stuff (the fullstack route), which I already know and breezed through. After completing the basics, it wont let me continue without paying for a pro account. My learning has stopped. I will have to go to another app to learn. The learning was ok. It was very gamified, but don't know how much would be retained from it. I even gave them my email thinking i could continue, but nope. I will be uninstalling."
A Google user,5,Nothing I just like it. It helps me alot even I'm a beginner :)
A Google user,5,Fun.
A Google user,5,outstanding 🔥🔥🔥

A Google user,5,"teaching methods are genuinely good, beginner friendly."
A Google user,4,"It's a nice app but the level of test questions is quite low and kind of like repeating the similar questions also there should be and option to skip the levels. One more issue is I cannot find support button in the app, if I have a doubt or find out some error nothing there to report to. Like in one of the example project ""unit converter"" there is a mistake in result statement. But where to address it."
A Google user,5,"Great app to learn to code, the ads are short."
A Google user,4,Nice App But I think they should add a little more language to it and they charge a premium for everything
A Google user,5,easy to use!
A Google user,1,"Felt like I wasn't learning anything, just like the bad language learning apps I'll just get a book... And maybe an audio book while driving"

A Google user,3,👌
A Google user,5,It is fabulous 👌
A Google user,4,"This app is amazing but you should definitely make a writing box where we can write codes by ourselves while we are learning a lesson. You put already written codes and we just gotta click on them but you should add more writing box. Well , I admire the app."
A Google user,4,it's a good device to learn
A Google user,4,very good explaining how zip code in the beginning
A Google user,4,"The app has been a great way to learn python, the concepts are properly broken down and explained, I am however unable to access the web learning platform using the urls provided in the emails. I hope this can be looked into."

A Google user,5,This is grat app I should recommend for learning purposes. All lessons are easily understandable and easy to use on net and offline
A Google user,5,love this app very easy to understand
A Google user,5,I think this the prefect for learning code
A Google user,1,Learning nothing

A Google user,5,this app is one of the best and relatable teaching softwares it will first ask you of your experience and then gives you the needed lessons
A Google user,4,I'm biggner I hope this app help me to learn coding.
A Google user,3,The idea is good the app isn't. It constantly freezes I click Start Learning or Continue and then nothing happens. I am an intermediate developer I wish I could skip all these basic html lessons which can be very boring and repetitive but there's no option to do so.
A Google user,5,Hey Mimo I am a user of this application and I want to tell you that you have been very useful for me to learn Programming. I want to learn C# also but your application has not C# learning courses. So I request you to please provide a course for C#. Thanks a lot.
A Google user,4,already file like a coder
A Google user,5,I liked it just like Duolingo like we playing game 🎯
A Google user,4,very good application
A Google user,3,It was easy to learn html
A Google user,5,It is nice and interesting way to learn coding. I am just trying it and find it quite good in first few lessons. gamification is also good.
A Google user,5,really enjoying learning python
A Google user,2,"Good app on the whole. Helps learning coding on the basic level. Though you CANNOT access projects advertised in the mobile app through web version, if you don't have a subscription. The app doesn't tell you that for some reason. Moreover, when I used a heart-refill, the app bugged-out and wouldnt let me off refill screen resulting in me losing progress in current lesson. REAL funny seeing this in app, which begs for money, promises to teach coding and simultaneously suffers such stupid bugs."
A Google user,5,best app for beginner coders
A Google user,4,Great learning app so far. Would appreciate if there allows users to skip levels by asking tests similar to Duolingo.
A Google user,2,"The app is great, but the company isn't. It’s easy to use and learn, but when I needed to use the website for a project, I found out I had to upgrade from the $60 Pro plan to Max just to proceed. I can’t even complete the program on Pro—it’s not just for advanced features. Feels like a cash grab. Canceling and finding another provider. What a shame!"
A Google user,5,"I've made it through the first module in just a couple days of ""spare time"" while accomplishing other tasks. If you're looking for a rewarding experience while learning how, when, and why to code, this may be what you're looking for."
A Google user,5,So far so good I guess literally just started
A Google user,1,just like every other code teacher it barely teaches you where things are supposed to actually go
A Google user,5,love the structure of this app. it really makes learning coding simple and at a perfect pace for someone like me with no experience.
A Google user,5,cool.
A Google user,4,"Works, but for some reason it randomly jumps around when moving to the next part of the course! It can be very frustrating and confusing 😕"
A Google user,5,The app is very interactive and makes coding simpler to understand.
A Google user,5,this is really a real educative app for ambitious coding leaners
A Google user,5,"so far, so good. it has proven easy to learn coding on Mimo as a beginner... everything is self-explanatory"
A Google user,1,This app is nice and helpful for web development beginners. And it is free unless you want premium features
A Google user,5,"I do Much Love This Mimo, Therefore I refer to this for easy learning of coding (full stack.....)."
A Google user,5,"I'm a complete newbie when it comes to coding but. I was always aspiring to be one. And mimo made it so easy for me. It even taught me how to code a website saying ""I'm aspiring to be a software developer"" so to mimo 💯🤟rock on"
A Google user,5,This is the best app for students and other peoples. This coding app is the greatest app I ever used.
A Google user,5,A very good application to learn coding

A Google user,4,Good
A Google user,4,great except you need to buy more things
A Google user,4,"It's a nice app, I would just like to ask if it would be possible to have a widget to remind me about my streaks, kind of like Duolingo does"
A Google user,3,"The good: I am def learning. I have apparently completed 5% of the full stack course. My mom+I looked into the HTML of a website to try to figure out why an image was stretched,&I was actually able to recognize some HTML, like border+margin size. It didn't help us figure out why the image was weird, but still. The bad: THE NOTIFICATIONS DON'T WORK. I have the notifications turned on inside and outside the app. I have them set to priority. My max streak is 4 days cause THE REMINDERS DON'T HAPPEN."
A Google user,5,If you are a newbie this is a great place to start. really simple yet effective teaching method makes this one of the best learning apps out there

A Google user,5,"I like this app, for a beginner like me, I am finding it easy to follow whats happening."
A Google user,5,An app that's just OUTSTANDING!! Are you and duolingo siblings?😹
A Google user,1,"Nothing against the app, but this is not the best way to learn. A better way to learn would be to put the stuff you learn to use which you can do for free using the actual languages on a computer and I find personally I had a better time learning from tutorials explaining what certain things do, the app felt very long and drawn out. If you are doing this to code video games, I recommend starting with Game Maker it is not overwhelming and easy to use."
A Google user,5,Bagus
A Google user,5,Excellent 👌🏽
A Google user,5,interesting concept
A Google user,5,"After 30 minutes lesson:

Now I'm hacker😎"
A Google user,5,"Awesome App for learning how to code. As an absolute beginner, this app has walked me through each aspect of the coding language I'm learning (Python) with easy to follow clarity. I highly recommend Mimo for those who want to learn coding."

A Google user,5,nc app its like Duolingo but you're learning how to code
A Google user,5,"I like this. Thanks to this i can atleast understand coding more and more, thank you!"
A Google user,3,"Simple and easy to follow lessons. However, I've run into an issue where I have to move around to different tabs on the app before it registers that I've completed a lesson. I've also just found that leaving the app for 20 minutes reset my lessons back to the beginning, though I still have my experience and missed lives."
A Google user,5,I just started learning coding today. I am really enjoying this app step by step teaching.

A Google user,5,few days in and I already feel 3x more comfortable with coding.
A Google user,2,FYI: currently charging $60 a year and you have to pay another $120 for the first year (with 50% discount) if you want to use the online resources. There are too many free choices out there to make this worth it.

A Google user,5,"Just starting to learn, and this app gives several examples to help me understand the basic line of python"
A Google user,5,Please provide an optional of monthly and yearly pay. I can't afford to pay yearly and would be beneficial for people like me who can only afford monthly subscription payments.

A Google user,5,I'm learning alot my day streak is 50! 😁
A Google user,3,Mimo is a nice app to learn coding but I can't see the image in HTML; I tried everything to find out how could people see the image but can't because I am an Indian so I can't understand a bit of intermediate english and the solutions by the app are only working not any other.
A Google user,4,so far so good
A Google user,5,It's be very nice app to learn programing it's very helpful
A Google user,5,easy to understand really since the learning is like task solving which gives you points on every task completion earlier also I have learned coding but this is something different from that learning probably it does not make you bored or tired of doing task more over the way the make you understand it's seems like that you are not learning you are almost playing probably it would be better for the people like me 🤪 who are beginner or an average and knows not much not little about coding
A Google user,5,great app

A Google user,5,A great App to learn with.
A Google user,1,"interessante, da pra brincar, atualmente tá tenso para realizar as atividades, dando erro de tempo excedido sempre que realizo os trechos se código. Vê um jeito de salvar as aulas e depois continuar, cheguei a fazer duas vez seguida um aula, porque meu celular mudou do wifi para os dados móveis, aí desanima de mais"
A Google user,1,So far first leasons are easy to learn then the next are horrible at explaining what's going on would not recommend for beginners

A Google user,3,"Easy to learn. But this only covers the basic skill level, without much practice."
A Google user,5,works
A Google user,5,nice app for me and making big progress in my code journey
A Google user,5,Mimo is a very good app. Easy to learn with
A Google user,5,It's Pretty Exciting and A Quick East Learning Process
A Google user,5,This is superb I love it!!!
A Google user,5,it is the best app I have ever used to learn coding from a zero
A Google user,5,fantastic
A Google user,5,"I've learned a bit of python from books, and that's hard sometimes. Mimo is more engaging and someone fun, whilst being educational!"
A Google user,5,great app
A Google user,5,"loving it, so far it's amazing"
A Google user,5,This is an awesome app to learn coding. I didn't know HTML was this simple. I'm glad I can start from here and build my webpage. Kudos!
A Google user,5,the best app to use in coding as someone who wants to learn alone. very easy to understand.
A Google user,3,"I don't typically write these, but I felt like this app needed it. The cost is $60 bucks a year for the Pro version to learn coding through the app, which is great, I've learned a lot so far. What they fail to mention is they have projects that can ONLY be completed through a web browser, which is accessed through their MAX tier level, which is $300 for the full year and $40 per month, basically 4X the amount one would pay for the Pro. I'll try to circumvent the Project portions."
A Google user,5,"Wow! There is alot of stuff to learn here folks. Alot of coding apps teach only the very basics, not this one though. It is both for beginners, and those have already have some experience. Best learning program I've tried yet, and I'm only getting started. *Update* Day 12 - I am at > 80% done the python course - no subscription. Thoughtfully answer questions and heart system works just fine."
A Google user,5,it really helpful
A Google user,3,"Mimo is a great app generally, but I found that since I chose the laptop and phone option, while all phone operations worked fine, with the exception of the laptop exercises, when I attempted to do those laptop exercises on the laptop, it wouldn't allow me to click on any tasks, and it didn't function for performing exercises. Also, I dislike that a streak is only withheld if there is an advancement, where I think it should be counted when a practice or review is done, as it's still effort made."
A Google user,5,really liking this app
A Google user,5,best app it teach me coding very fast
A Google user,5,I'm starting out on mimo and I've realized how easy coding is!
A Google user,5,It is really a fun app and it changes my life to learn coding this way!

A Google user,5,this is very nice for Learn coding
A Google user,5,"So simple and easy to follow in bit sizes. Excited, so far, to get on with the training on mimo."
A Google user,5,"great and fun to use. if you are serious enough to learn coding, try out this app. at some point, you will be addicted to coding - very pratical and user friendly. The only glitch is this - when your heart finish in the middle of your difficult/long exercise, so you click the option to fill-up your heart, but then the app just freeze and cannot return to your exercise - meaning you have to start over again. if you can fix this, it will be encouraging. thank you."
A Google user,5,so good..... you really can try if are want to start coding... this app helps a lot so can prepare yourself...

A Google user,5,"Couldn't recommend an app higher, easy to digest, stick too, and it's free. Thanks devs."
A Google user,1,"Ironically, it's buggy. Does not keep track of your progress and does not let you progress on the lessons. It just keeps staring it's ""offline"" regardless of the network used, very frustrating. Don't download and specially, do not pay for it. There are free apps that are better."
A Google user,5,"Only used it for a day but so far so good, It makes sense"

A Google user,5,Great
A Google user,5,Genial
A Google user,5,"Amazing learning game, interactive and easy to comprehend"
A Google user,4,لاتوجد لغة عربية
A Google user,1,"DO NOT BUY! Complete waste of money, better put towards better apps. And as some mention, buying the upgrade won't allow you to use the web verison (writing code on the phone is a slog). They'll quiz you on thing you haven't learned yet and checking the reference material there's alot missing, leaving you with more questions than answers..."
A Google user,5,good app for learning coding
A Google user,4,"Seems like a good way to learn coding so far. Wish there was a mobile way to do the big lessons, and it would be nice to be able to go back and review anything from previous lessons (there's a reference, but it's missing most of what is taught)"
A Google user,5,nice it is teaching us the basics of programming in a very easy way love it ☺️❤️
A Google user,5,oh yeah
A Google user,5,"Lol....Oh I don't know to wrap my head around coding. You lied, download this and they will teach you from kindergarten style till you understand how simple coding works. But when you get advanced in it, then when curiosity abounds it becomes brain tasking and then you get close to being a God of tech. Lol...I mean this app is really helpful."
A Google user,1,Tried te start the app. But I can only fill in a question list and that's it. Then it brings me to a pay page... No free try or anthing
A Google user,5,Why the apps have to pay ?!
A Google user,4,it should be completely 🆓 free 😠😤💀💔🥺🐃🐃🐃🐃🐃🐃🍍🍍🍍🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈👋🏿👋🏿👋🏿👋🏿👋🏿👋🏿🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻
A Google user,5,"New user, lessons are very easy to understand"
A Google user,4,"good learning app, It's very helpfully for beginners"
A Google user,2,"I've just deleted the app. With many reasons. 1. Rushed lessons, I have experienced it the 4th time and this brings us with the 2nd reason; 2. Confusing questions, honestly I only can see gibberish with rushed lessons, like you can have a boolean with two parameters and 2 other values without using the && keyword with JS. 3. The IDE sucks, whatever you call it, it doesn't give me the feeling of an IDE where it makes another line when i want to. This leads to confusing scripts and more confusion."
A Google user,5,"Feels like it was designed for kids, pretty simple to navigate and easy enough to understand for all ages."
A Google user,5,Nice app just a few ads and premium is cheap
A Google user,5,"I learnt html in high school, but this has been a great refresher. I wish I could of learnt through this app. It explains concepts amazingly and holds your hand just enough that you get the concepts, but not so much that you feel bored &/ not challenged"
A Google user,5,studying is good but plan is big
A Google user,5,Excellent app for beginners In coding
A Google user,5,So far so good I'm learning the basics of coding rather than being overwhelmed by YouTube videos
A Google user,5,app to learn😉
A Google user,4,"It is really helpful for a person who don't know about coding like me. There are so many Programming languages to learn in there. The display is addictive and interactive. And the explanation is very understandable. But, suddenly there are no Bahasa Indonesia in there. Please developer, add Bahasa Indonesia for other language options....."
A Google user,5,"Скоро пойду работать на программиста,а так приложение напоминает дуолинго,имба"
A Google user,5,duolingo for coding minus the annoying ads
A Google user,2,"It's cool, but I can't use it on my laptop. What's up with that?"
A Google user,5,its easy to learn
A Google user,4,"1. User friendly 2. Step by step concepts clearing 3. Gently saying that You learn coding from zero to the level between intermediate and Advanced. 3. Python, HTML, CSS, JAVA script, SQL, React, Frontend, Backend & Full stack developing is available in this app. It is my request to mimo group to add c, c++ and c# course in this app."
A Google user,5,Masha Allah! it's a great experience.
A Google user,4,I like the app... But....it keeps Crashing and says Mimo has a bug. So when I practice tasks after I've completed a couple the app crashes and I lose all my progress and I have to start over again.
A Google user,5,Fun app and very educational
A Google user,5,A wonderful app The convenience of learning coding and setting goals and even the teaching and learning mechanism is topnotch

A Google user,5,"Love the App. Great way of learning new skill, detailed lessons and good examples of what you're actually coding. There's a place for practice and building your own playground all for free. The paying version promises even better lessons and support for if you really want to dive in deeper but the basic version is absolutely perfect to get you started!"
A Google user,5,"great app, easy to understand the lessons"
A Google user,5,very recommending
A Google user,5,so engaging in too simple to learn

A Google user,5,"fire UI, super responsive, repetitive in a good way to solidify knowledge. Excellent app for beginners"
A Google user,5,Simple and Understanding.
A Google user,5,Nice!
A Google user,3,"As many others already mentioned, the code editor is very inconvenient. Also, if you're using your phone's auto completion, it loses random letters from the words. When the task in practice has several solutions, it will accept only the hardcoded one, the rest will be rejected even if they are correct."
A Google user,5,Very Good hehe
A Google user,4,"The concept and execution of this app is flawless. I do have a petition for something that I think the app should do: when I switch from front end developer route to full stack, I have to retake the same exact courses, the progress should be global imo, since they're the same exact content :-)"
A Google user,5,Great app
A Google user,4,this app is very nice to learning. it's obviously good for learning. thank you mimo app for learning coding to me 💯
A Google user,5,I have wanted to learn code for a while and didn't know where to start. Someone mentioned how this app is like Duolingo but for coding and that's so true! The app is so easy to use and it makes coding seem easy. I definitely recommend this app!
A Google user,5,Perfect for beginners in coding.
A Google user,5,"Just like an interactive, fun app to learn coding wether if you are a beginner or an intermediate. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

A Google user,4,awesome thanks for bringing it up
A Google user,5,Great app to learn coding 💯
A Google user,1,"This is not a free course oe app, you get very few lessons for free."
A Google user,2,"Thought this would be a good way to learn but things like the heart mechanic really gets in the way and stunts the learning prosses ( especially if ur new). I recommend everyone should go on a browser and search for ""W3Schools"". It's WAY better then this and you can learn what you want at any time totally free."
A Google user,5,good starter for those who want to learn code. It walks you through the coding step by step 👍
A Google user,4,"It's Great app for beginners for learning code as a student for me. It kind a of resembles to ""DUOLINGO APP"" which is quite fun to play with ....! But only issue is Advertisement...over all its good 😊👍"
A Google user,5,Good but add java
A Google user,3,not good but not bad
A Google user,5,"I made a post about this and recommended this on LinkedIn. This app is great for anyone who is looking because they are curious about coding, and when they see it, they just see a bunch of gibberish. More seasoned devs may get a little bored, but as someone who works using React.js, these front-end basics are actually quite fun due to the set up of the app feeling like a game. This app is better than your ""just to kill time"" app and can set you up for discovering or improving your tech career."
A Google user,1,"The Mimo platform claims to be an educational tool for learning programming, but it is nothing more than a greedy, disrespectful scam. You’re forced to buy two separate subscriptions—one for the mobile app and another for the website, which is necessary for accessing exercises. This anti-user approach demonstrates unnecessary greed, causing confusion and frustration while ignoring users’ real needs. Don’t waste your time or money on this app."
A Google user,4,so far with my journey of coding with Mimo has been wonderful
A Google user,5,one of the coolest programming app!
A Google user,5,very important apk to learning html
A Google user,5,I like this it is like doingo except it's for robotics and coding

A Google user,5,Nice one
A Google user,5,fun
A Google user,5,easy to learn and work with
A Google user,3,"This app is awesome, but I wish it was more like a combination of Finch and Duo: you get a little character to motivate you to continue every day and spend your points on to clothe and house (Finch) and you get a home screen widget to see your daily streak (Duolingo). I often forget about Mimo but I never forget about Duolingo because of that widget pestering me politely to practice everyday. I REALLY WANT A DAILY STREAK WIDGET!!! 😭 Plus it also need to be more like the others with more audio."
A Google user,5,I have never seen an app as good as this
A Google user,5,it's very educational and easy to follow along! loving the learning experience so far!

A Google user,5,I think this is??????????
A Google user,1,"Did not order but still being charged $63.59. I purchased a new phone, and turned my old phone to factory reset. However, the day I saw I was subscribed for this, i canceled it. Ivan canceled I even canceled the day prior to the payment date, which was about a week after i was hacked. I've tried to submit for a return on this invalid purchase with NO LUCK! They ARE SCAMMERS - and they WILL rip you off. Guess I'll be taking them to small claims court, where I'll win by default (no lawyers)."

A Google user,5,I like it
A Google user,1,"Préférer Sololearn en version complète pour moins de 50€. Mimo vous fait payer 30€ pour la version Pro qui est très limitée. Par exemple, les projets les plus importants ne peuvent pas être réalisés sur l'application ET l'application vous renvoie vers la version PC. Pour pouvoir réellement travailler il faut payer la version Max à plus de 200€. La version Pro n'est là que pour vous appâter. En plus, vous êtes continuellement harcelé par les propositions d'abonnement à la version Max. À fuir !!!"
A Google user,5,best
A Google user,5,Great
A Google user,5,You will never find something better than this for Android environment.
A Google user,2,"One of the reasons I ever subscribed was the streak repairing feature. But today I discovered that my streak is suddenly broken after 99 days, despite yesterday I've completed 4(!) assignments in a row and received XPs for them. But it was only half of the surprise. The second half was a notification, that I've lost my streak and won't be able to repair it! Excuse me? I had all my repairs unused! I feel deceived now, so I just canceled my subscription. Thank you."
A Google user,5,Love Mimo for how the lessons are designed. Really breaks down everything for beginners.
A Google user,5,It is the best website for coding

A Google user,5,I am learning so much from this app. They will give you multiple choice answers or make you type the answer for the coding example they give. I really recommend this app to anyone wanted to learn coding. It's a very good experience for me.
A Google user,5,educative
A Google user,5,"That's a great app, easy to learn!"
A Google user,5,This app is very useful for students who want to learn different coding languages which can be useful in their studies and life and the main and important part of the app is that it is free so everyone can use this app .
A Google user,5,it's very helpful for students
A Google user,5,Great app to learn coding. enjoying every minute learning.

A Google user,5,I love the app.
A Google user,4,"it's a well-prepared app for coding, but it would have been better if it didn't have a premium."
A Google user,5,Great App! Kindly minimise the pop-ups appearing while coding. They float all the time unnecessarily and are very distracting.
A Google user,5,Best
A Google user,5,great way to learn I like it
A Google user,5,"Para quem tem dificuldade para aprender, esse é o lugar certo, eu mesmo aprendi mais aqui em dois exercícios que em uma aula no meu curso"
A Google user,3,"I want to give you 5 starts but i give 3 stars because the streak function must be improved just like ""duolingo"" app it's really good and easy but I hope you slove this problem!!"
A Google user,3,"I already know some python and wanted something to help me jot down ideas and learn new things. The code writer seems ok, but you can't import anything and it's an old version. For learning it does seem fun, very similar to Duolingo. But there's no way to skip ahead, so despite telling the app that I am at an intermediate level, I have to go through the bare bone basics. I do think it's good if you're brand new, and need more of a dopamine hit to start, but it's not really for me."
A Google user,5,MIMO is wonderful and astonishing. You just want to continue non-stop. I found it very interesting app to learn. Kudos to the developer of this App.
A Google user,5,ITS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING IF YOU WANT TO LEARN CODING 🤩
A Google user,5,as being a beginner i hope for the best although app is working good and smoothly
A Google user,5,it's very good
A Google user,3,still in it
A Google user,5,A new fun ways to learn
A Google user,4,"Great for learning individual skills such as coding a like button into a website, but I'm not able to type the codes, I have to click and drag. I think typing is an important part of this learning process that we dont get access to in this app. The limited access to certain app functions unless you pay, but that's a given."
A Google user,5,Thank you so much
A Google user,5,Super fun and bay the start was it esy
A Google user,4,Nice
A Google user,5,This app very helpful for new developer&need support to promote this

A Google user,4,it's super good and even interesting it feels like game and it also provides correct course for u based on ur interests . it also reviews the old information however u cn use it for free for only some topics but overall best for beginners 🎀

A Google user,4,It's better than youtube cores
A Google user,4,I wish I could have used this app five months ago. it's very cool
A Google user,5,awesome
A Google user,5,the best free coding app
A Google user,1,"Apart from the prize system. - the tasks don't get more difficult. It always stays easy with more difficult topics but you don't need to think alot, normally you can answer the tasks just by looking in the description of the task. Learning effect: 🤏 Prize:👎 Free for a couple days, then it's €9.99/month for the Pro version, and a few days after that, you need the €40/month Max version just to keep going."
A Google user,5,A good way to learn coding
A Google user,5,mimo is the best learning site to the upcoming generation of programmer
A Google user,3,Can only access on my old phone.
A Google user,1,"It is great and you get to learn new things from it. But though,it is actually simple."
A Google user,5,"Mimo has helped me learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python from beginner to expert, highly recommend!"
A Google user,5,easy to learn and follow
A Google user,4,"Not a bad learning app, it's good for a beginner."

A Google user,5,nice app
A Google user,3,The app is good so far if l learn finally everything l will put 5
A Google user,5,cool
A Google user,5,"Outstanding learning app. The makers really understand how people learn, with really well-paced spaced repetition and very intuitive ramp up, and an understanding of what a complete novice would find difficult, or get tripped up by. And the execution of that learning journey is excellent, with gamification and celebration pitched at the right level, and enough humour and cultural references to support interest and retention."
A Google user,5,if an idiot like me can learn programming with this app anyone can. it doesn't melt my brain like traditional studying does. 11/10
A Google user,5,great
A Google user,4,good
A Google user,5,It is good for learning coding.
A Google user,5,really great for learning and it's fun too

A Google user,5,so far it's cool
A Google user,5,very very good app
A Google user,5,love this
A Google user,5,Great app! you are the one missing out. Check it out!
A Google user,4,"Mimo is a great app. I am a beginner in web development. Mimo helps me to stay on track and reduce distractions, like instead of playing games on my phone or watching social media, I am learning and revising the tech course I signed up for in web development. The only thing I can say is that I think one needs, at the least knowledge on web development or whatever course you want to learn . Mimo makes it more fun to learn but a zero beginner might not understand everything in each lesson. Thanks."
A Google user,5,good
A Google user,5,Just started this far loving this app and learning how to code!
A Google user,4,nice
A Google user,4,"i dont know if im learning, i just started, ill update thisbinna year and let you know"
A Google user,5,it's very useful for coding i suggest you
A Google user,5,good please offer free version with ads like the green bird language app
A Google user,5,Best and the better app i ever seen
A Google user,5,Mimo is the best coding app but I wish I could use it by vpn
A Google user,5,"The app is super easy to use! The enticing learning structure was addicting!! YAY, I'm finally learning to code!!!"
A Google user,5,I love the app honestly one of the best apps for learning coding I have one problem I sometime don't understand the words or the instruction you know but still one of the best apps ever
A Google user,5,love the app 💜
A Google user,5,Super easy and highly inciting app to learn coding at level zero. Daily remainders are worth so much more than anything. I highly recommend this app to everyone who has an inner fire about coding 😍
A Google user,5,"I'm now learning coding so fast🤯! In less than an hour, I had already learnt how to create a button. This is going to help me so much at School🤓. This definitely deserves a five star shot!⭐⭐🌟⭐⭐"
A Google user,5,thanks for the great appreciation
A Google user,4,"The app is awesome it has helped me a lot earlier I didn't know anything about coding but after practicing in this app I came to know about many things good app,but the worst thing is that if your hearts are finished you can't refil them and without the hearts you are unable to start your lessons you have to wait whole 5 or 6 minutes for the hearts to refil and it says to take the pro version for unlimited hearts which is about₹100000 please developers fix it ."
A Google user,5,awesome app you can try it and realise that coding is not tough to learn because of this app
A Google user,4,"Mimo simplifies coding with gamified, interactive lessons, ideal for beginners. Its sleek design and rewards ensure steady progress. However, it falls short for advanced learners due to limited depth and lack of real-world applications. The subscription cost feels steep, and repetitive lessons may reduce engagement. While Mimo offers a great entry point into coding, it lacks the depth to foster mastery, serving as an inspiring first step rather than a full learning solution."
A Google user,3,Doesnt let you skip ahead at all
A Google user,5,intelligent exercise
A Google user,5,it's a good app to learn thank you.
A Google user,5,"I began to use this app recently, I dont have much info. So far, it's actually amazing. It is super easy to understand, and maybe even a kid could grasp the concept with this. I love the UI, it's very nice and friendly. They do have a subscription for better earning, but so far I haven't encountered a SINGLE paywall. Maybe they just dont shove the paywalls in your face (thankfully). I like the streak idea. It compels me to do it daily, and I'm thankful for that. Whoops, I've hit 500 characters.."
A Google user,5,Seems very user-friendly. I'm really enjoying it!
A Google user,5,Good👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
A Google user,5,nice one
A Google user,5,very good app

A Google user,5,DIY CODING TUTOR
A Google user,5,great apps to learn and can improve our digital programming skills.. thank you mimo.
A Google user,5,Amazing app. Like duolingo for coding
A Google user,5,"Duolingo but for coding. Really simple algorithm, puts old lessons into the new lessons to remind you of what you've previously learnt so you don't forget. Brilliant app."
A Google user,5,mimo helps me do practice on my phone 📱 wherever I am and whenever I want.very important to people like me who don't have a computer
A Google user,5,"With Mimo, you're the best programmer"
A Google user,5,Easy for a beginner
A Google user,1,This app doesn't provides me 2 week free pro by inviting the friends .
A Google user,3,great app
A Google user,5,that's best apps in the world
A Google user,5,this is a very useful app for beginners coders I also like that 😀
A Google user,5,"easy and free, is literally duolingo for coding, except they won't hunt down and brutally slaughter your family 😃😃👍👍"
A Google user,1,Not free as advertised
A Google user,5,I love how this app teaches you the basics of coding it's very easy to follow instructions
A Google user,5,Great app
A Google user,4,good
A Google user,3,It's a free trial then you have to pay for it by the month. Not what I was looking for
A Google user,5,very educational
A Google user,5,Awesome
A Google user,1,"Waste of time. Adverts, asking to register, pay subscription, set reminders and so on. Also very very basic."
A Google user,5,This is very nice app. I like it very much 😍.
A Google user,5,cool for learning step by step coding.
A Google user,4,thank you
A Google user,5,I'm on my deck coder get your on decode flip make plays like hotspots without no French fries
A Google user,5,best app for beginners
A Google user,5,I think for the first day I've really enjoyed it but if your remembrance is not good you have to write it down because I've learned so much on the first day hoping to see another app of yours
A Google user,5,very helpful for coding day 4 and almost done for 1st part of full stack developer tanks a lot
A Google user,4,best 👌
A Google user,3,ADD LUA >:(
A Google user,5,Nice to learn js on android device
A Google user,5,Fantastic!
A Google user,5,"Really the best, try it out, you won't regret"
A Google user,5,Nice app for beginners 👍❤️
A Google user,5,Great.
A Google user,4,parfect for basics of cording
A Google user,5,just great
A Google user,5,Happy to have that😍
A Google user,5,super app like duolingo just for coding
A Google user,5,This is the best so far but my only problem with the app is that I have invited some friends but still I haven't gotten the two weeks mimo pro
A Google user,5,it is very interesting
A Google user,1,"Not having a way to change your email is a pain, I got locked out of my Gmail and I can't reset my password and lost all my progress. Customer support sucks even tho I got a lifetime membership before it was removed. Like they don't want to honor their old subscriptions for those that started when the app was getting up."
A Google user,5,Fantastic and interactive app for learning to code
A Google user,5,begginer friendly app
A Google user,5,"(max user) I've been using this app for 2 months now. and i think this is really good for people who wants to practice time to time when u r on phone, good to learn when u r on web. i am a student and only this app keeps me going without any struggle. i love it. it's good (sry for the bad english)"
A Google user,5,"good, but the progress is too slow, it should have option to choose from speed levels which allows tougher exercise to level up faster if someone is not struggling in learning, and easier speed levels for those who learns slowly"
A Google user,5,"It's Really Helpful, I mean I can do what my friends going to school (to learn coding) can"
A Google user,5,gud
A Google user,5,This is so lovely. Easiest way I ever seen to learn coding.
A Google user,1,Doesn't work
A Google user,1,Can't skip... so boring
A Google user,5,"This is a pretty cool app, people saying chat gpt can do what coders do is wrong. Not anybody can hop on chat and program things like some of these vet devs. Trust me I tried lol. This is the first time I'm feeling like I'm actually understanding the language and syntax."
A Google user,5,nice I appreciate this app
A Google user,5,I'm really not kidding it's totally best to learn basic to advanced if u didn't get results then you can delete it but trust me it's the best app
A Google user,5,"Just an amazing app. It teaches you in a simple amd fun way. Tests your knowledge and just actually teaches you. It's kind of like duolingo. I like that it has a streak and a leader board that motivates you to learn more. Once you're done with one course, you xam just head on to another one. Their pro feature isn't too expensive either. I've come across many coding apps, but this one is by far number 1. Thankyou for making my coding journey easy :)"
A Google user,5,Thank you
A Google user,1,Since you obviously want your members to pay over £200 a year to buy your PC version you make the text jump around on the phone version when trying to type in. I'm not buying the max version it's too expensive but attempting to make people do it by making the mobile app frustrating to use is going to make you lose customers
A Google user,5,great app. it's teaches alot
A Google user,5,makes learning fun...love it!!...especially the jokes in between. Tjoh..the italics one🤣🤣🤣 yall got me!!
A Google user,5,I've never coded before but with this app it's easy and fun.🤑😗💯💚

A Google user,5,i thought that this is gonna be hard but actually it's easy 5stars my ni- no no I'm not racist ;)
A Google user,5,I've improved with my coding skill using this app.
A Google user,2,The app is good to learn basic coding but if you fail once you lose 1 out of 5 hearts and each heart takes like 2 hours or something to get back and i cant afford to pay that much for pro just to get infinite hearts and no ads its a good way to learn but its quite annoying with ads limited hearts and not even a full course.
A Google user,5,very good program that can help with the basic of understanding how coding works
A Google user,5,best app for learning html. I love this app ❤️❤️❤️
A Google user,5,it's a great app
A Google user,5,"I just started 10 minutes ago. I knew absolutely nothing about coding. I've already picked up how to create buttons, how to make certain words bigger or smaller, and how to put a break in between sentences. wow!!! I'm loving it so far!"
A Google user,5,"This app gave me a taste of coding. I'm not naturally gifted but the introductory lessons piqued my interest so I'm thinking of obtaining two subscriptions in 2025. One is for myself, and one for my kid to learn new stuff."
A Google user,5,The best way to learn coding.

A Google user,3,it's wonderful app 👏
A Google user,1,Was looking for an app to help me practice on my phone certain code languages i have to learn for work. Instead it places me to the very beginning of a fullstack course (despite answering that i had a lot of experience. I work in development already) not letting me choose exactly the language I want to learn or practice. I uninstalled almost immediately. It's just not what I am looking for.
A Google user,5,Maybe you should add another languages. i mean like spanish...

A Google user,3,The app is glitching and for 70 euro should be better. When you are in the practice section just resets your progress on some answers. I am sorry I paid for it
A Google user,4,the apps seems to be pretty good at making things sound simple. I'm currently learning react. has been pretty good so far. Of course you would have to know basic of html css js . hopefully I can get a hold and get comfortable with react by the end of the course.

A Google user,4,The app sometimes feels lifeless. The questions can occasionally be vague.
A Google user,1,You are taking too much fees aur money from users at least you have to take a under 500 rupees as your launching this app in India most of the people from India love to pay interest where the only affordable price is available. Please decrease the amount so that every Indians can use this app. In second thing is payment should be safe or they should we know fraud or money is a very essential part middle class. And please design this app accordingly To the CBSE of class 12&11.

A Google user,4,"Mimo is the best option on the market at the moment but the 1 thing keeping from 5 stars is how they say ""it was 79.99 but now its 39.99 and this is the last sale we will do but next month they do the same sale"" when you buy mimo max it gives you infinite hearts but then you don't have consequences for failure making it even more difficult to code but other than that its the best one I've used and it is a very very good option"

A Google user,5,lgmt si
A Google user,3,"Decent app; as a novice, it helped me greatly, but sometimes it didn't explain some things in the code, so I didn't know what was going on—like how to shorten a link or what ""ol"" is. Also, after I learned a bit about CSS, the practice required me to use normal HTML, so I was unsure how to proceed. I also hate when I get something wrong and run out of hearts I come the next day and get it wrong again so I'm now stuck for like 4 days on the same thing that's completely useless too."
A Google user,5,it is great.
A Google user,5,"Yeah, I like this app. makes coding seem less intimidating"

A Google user,5,"Frankly speaking, mimo is the best programing app I've ever seen before. The only thing I request, do your best to give mimo pro on mobile phone.

I personally have learned programming from Mimo, I started with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and then moved on with more Advanced Stuff like ReactJS and back-end development. I highly highly recommend Mimo because it teaches programming in a interactive way, where you have to type text, or drag blocks, which may be great for learning to some people."

A Google user,5,"A mani basse la migliore app per imparare a programmare da zero, oppure se, come me, siete già pratici con la programmazione e volete imparare un nuovo linguaggio. Concetti spiegati in modo facile e chiaro, senza però tralasciare concetti. L'ambiente sviluppato e stimolante e simpatico, mai noioso, a tratti posto come un gioco, una sfida, per non farti annoiare. Il piano a pagamento offre l'esperienza migliore, però si può tranquillamente seguire i corsi anche con il piano gratuito."
A Google user,5,Best best best

A Google user,4,"Your desktop app is very tasking and even frustrating. Having exhausted all the lessons on the mobile app, I was redirected to the desktop app. The lessons that I am expected to continue on the desktop app are simply not available. I am not happy at all.with the transition from the phone mobile app to the desktop exercises."
A Google user,5,Good for practicing concepts and refreshing yourself on basics similar to Duolingo's method s.

A Google user,5,Best coding app
A Google user,5,Nice app
A Google user,4,"I feel like there is lot of wasted potential with max subscription. The point where you have to go to web to code a project but instead of coding you get asked for upgrade from pro to MAX. Also I would change a type of questions in the end of each lesson to make a code by yourself instead of just selecting word by word. Anyway at first it was like 6/5 stars, but after almost a week of using it. I can see some flaws"
A Google user,5,very nice
A Google user,4,it a great app for learning and opportunity

A Google user,5,"This is super excellent app that frankly teach us coadings with our type of understanding manner, it's my opinion to this app for their outstanding performing and gestures like teaching style, and it is helpful in future if we choosing place released to compute,so it is tooo helpful app that I recommend to teach coadings bettterly."

A Google user,5,great learning experience
A Google user,5,It's a lot of fun like playing a game
A Google user,3,"Mimo is a great app for learning codes for beginners, experienced code developers, or code designers."
A Google user,5,"I advise everyone who wants to learn programming to download this program, it is very wonderful. 🙌🏻"
A Google user,3,Nice 👍 I really enjoyed it 😀 but What I don't get is can I learn python when I'm learning HTML or after I finished learning HTML?
A Google user,5,so far so cool... I'll update if I can write fluent Python when I'm finished...
A Google user,3,great application for learners i'm so happy
A Google user,5,"this help so so MUCH I really like it.Thank you so much for this,developers"
A Google user,4,"So let me start by saying that out of all the coding tutorial apps I've tried this is the best one. That being said, there are a few glitches that I'd very much like to be sorted out. For one, when in lessons the cursor likes to randomly jump to the beginning of the first line, which is REALLY annoying. Secondly, the app seems to struggle to sync with the desktop version which sucks cause I paid for that. Lastly, you can only check coins and leaderboard on the mobile app =[ still, great app"
A Google user,5,fun. i even paid for it!
A Google user,5,tiny yet power app for learners and intermediate skill developers.
A Google user,4,until now its good to me
A Google user,5,I love this app! Very easy to understand and I hardly know a thing about computers. Strongly recommend if you would like to learn!
A Google user,5,Preety helpful
A Google user,5,"honestly, not bad it feels a bit like Duolingo but for learning some base code."
A Google user,4,pretty good
A Google user,5,like Duolingo but without an angry owl 🦉
A Google user,5,nice experience so far
A Google user,5,"Great app, I love it!"
A Google user,5,No one has made complex learning as simple. I salute you Gentlepeople 🙏🏼
A Google user,5,I like it ☺️💕
A Google user,5,good
A Google user,4,I like the app very much but the renewal of hearts is too slow something 3 hours . So please improve that and make it faster Edit : I loved the new updates of the practicing session
A Google user,3,Still needs polishing for the cross-platform progression.. you can't really go back and forth between mobile and desktop version as any practice/projects you do on desktop arent marked as completed on the mobile version. Quite frustrating cause I can't start the next chapter when I'm not on my computer without completing those on mobile as well
A Google user,5,"good, but we can choose another programing language if we already pick something"
A Google user,5,"Very helpful! I'm a young learner and am very stupid, but this is just amazing! Best app for coding I've used by far."
A Google user,5,Good
A Google user,4,good prog I like but you train hard because our life is hard

A Google user,5,it should not be paid but a very nice app I liked it very much
A Google user,3,its alright l guess
A Google user,2,Good to get some ideas but most of the testing is just wrong. Do not use if you are new to programming. It also randomly drops your streak.
A Google user,5,Very satisfying and I start loving it.🤩
A Google user,5,everyone must start at some point. this is the start u must try.
A Google user,5,bas ye agar heart vala system nahi hota to ye sbse best app hota... seriously amazing hai
A Google user,5,"makes it amusing to learn how to code! it is really hard for me to commit to things like mimo, but with the help of a friend and the way the app is structured, I think I'll be staying here for a while!"
A Google user,4,so far it's oky let see we're it takes me
A Google user,5,great experience
A Google user,4,"So far this has been the winner app for me. I've wanted to learn to code for past 10yrs. I know a ton about technology electronics etc. I always end up at a dead end bc coding will always be the next step when trying to advance in the world of ""IT"". Until now, I've always Attempted to learn in many different ways but also ended up the same more confused than when I started. This app breaks coding down into simple step by step instructions to keep you motivated instead of overwhelmed with doubt."

A Google user,5,excellent
A Google user,5,this is the best
A Google user,5,"its good, but some is pide.Overall i like the app and enjoying it."
A Google user,5,I like it.
A Google user,5,1. Add massage options for important conversation 2.add cloud storage 3. Add note pad to write personal details of codeing which is always save and sequre their
A Google user,5,good app
A Google user,1,"I purchased a Lifetime subscription to Mimo, but they moved features I paid for into a new tier, ""Mimo Max,"" reducing my access. This bait-and-switch tactic is unethical. Support only offered a discount instead of honoring the original agreement. Beware—Mimo's ""Lifetime"" promise doesn't hold up. I can't recommend this app."
A Google user,5,best for beginners
A Google user,2,fi🙏🙏🙏🙏
A Google user,5,noice
A Google user,4,This is the best coding app but it will be better if u can reduce the amount of time to wait before gaining a heat like wait for 45mins. Pls reduce the time from 3hrs to like 45mins or 1hr max
A Google user,5,I have been half using this app for 7 years now but somehow i feel very ready to be serious about learning how to code
A Google user,5,nice
A Google user,3,Losing progress when the app should be running in the background is not fun.
A Google user,5,it's actually good
A Google user,4,I 👍 it!

A Google user,5,Great app on how to learn coding

A Google user,5,MY GOAL- LEARN ALL LANGUAGES THAT'S NECESSARY ✨
A Google user,5,"Mimo is the best thing. i knew nothing about coding, but now i know so much more. i truly love Mimo"
A Google user,5,"For a newbie like me, this is amazing and presented very well in a easy to learn structure, keep adding more to the free plan, im more than happy to have adds 😁"
A Google user,5,it's good and easy best for bigginers

A Google user,5,"it's really cool app, am able to learn more with the interactive games and problems, best app for beginers"
A Google user,5,nice
A Google user,5,Duolingo for coding!
A Google user,5,amazing
A Google user,4,really interesting and easy learning
A Google user,4,"I dunno why people give it such bad ratings, it's a great app. Perfect for practicing for free, you really don't need the subscriptions at least not right away. I wouldn't say it's good for beginners though cuz it doesn't really explain why things are important. It could be a little more detailed for people who need more of an explanation."
A Google user,5,It's like duolingo but it's coding instead. I actually enjoy logging in to learn because it's easy and decently short depending on your course. 10/10
A Google user,5,I Love it
A Google user,5,"this app is good, make me learn coding in earlier age"
A Google user,5,"I always wanted to code with HTML/Javascript, or any other traditional coding language. But every time I looked at it, it was so overwhelming and scary. Once I found this app, it started to make a lot more sense. Easy to understand and quick lessons. Structure of the app itself is very similar to Duolingo."
A Google user,4,it's really good for beginners
A Google user,4,nice application for learn code
A Google user,5,it's a great app and it makes you understand things step by step
A Google user,5,ayuda con los fundamentos bastante al inicio

A Google user,5,good
A Google user,5,"Absolute wonderful customer service! Friendly, fast helpful and generous. I wish, more companies were like this. I hope you guys keep it up! I can't say too much about the app, as my 10 year old son had been using it. He really enjoyed it at the time and completed his python certificate. It starts at beginners level, so it is very suitable for kids. The app is well structured and easy to use"
A Google user,4,great app for slow learner
A Google user,5,It's a great experience but the only problem I had faced is recently I had uninstalled Mimo by mistake and when I re downloaded it and login my Google account it showed me full stack developer course but I was in python ai devlopment it had completed its 33% now what can I do please help(edit- now it's working)
A Google user,5,really appreciate this one 😀 it's a great app for learning
A Google user,5,so far so good
A Google user,4,it's great to learn coding at this platform...
A Google user,5,BEST EVER!?
A Google user,5,good
A Google user,5,Appreciated UI and UX design Powered by their beginners friendly curriculum.
A Google user,5,fun
A Google user,2,"The app continues to get worse as it goes, losing your progress and streak randomly despite doing lessons wouldn't be as annoying if the practice area of the app didn't also completely populate itself with skills and lessons that you haven't covered, and the actual lessons continue to do less to explain what and WHY you're doing what you're doing as you go, making it nearly pointless at times because you don't know when to use what you're learning."
A Google user,5,wow
A Google user,5,it's very helpful for beginners
A Google user,5,Thank you
A Google user,5,love the app😍🥰
A Google user,5,it is a best app for coding
A Google user,5,Learning code is SO much easier with this
A Google user,5,best app for coding
A Google user,4,It would be good to add a 2×1 widget to tell us wether we have practised or not like Duolingo. Please make the widget. Otherwise it is the best coding app to learn coding.
A Google user,5,"This app is amazing for beginners wanting to learn coding for Web Development. I've learned so much valuable information in just my first week of studying. There are plenty of exercises to practice a newly introduced concept each time. The free version is packed with such great information, that I'm willing and confident in purchasing the paid version for additional content."
A Google user,1,"Poor Customer Service and Lack of Transparency. I asked Mimo simple questions about their subscription: Will I get a free trial with Max(if i buy on monthly basis)? If I buy MAX in mid of month, how long will the subscription last (till the end of month or for next 30 days) ? What are the cancellation fees? Instead of clear answers, I got unhelpful links. This lack of transparency is frustrating. I can't recommend Mimo until they improve their customer service."
A Google user,5,coding is hard
A Google user,5,best of the best
A Google user,5,it's very good and helpful for children
A Google user,5,excellent app

A Google user,5,this app is very good for beginners who are learning coding. I would recommend it for everyone
A Google user,5,we can learn coding in a fun and relaxing manner
A Google user,4,amazing app with the best knowledge that get you learn 👏 🙌
A Google user,5,nice
A Google user,4,"This will take time but You will learn many things, give 10 min daily in this is better to waste 2hr on Instagram"
A Google user,5,nice app
A Google user,5,Very simple education tips. am very intersted.
A Google user,3,"Mimo is truly a career building tool, with simple UI and modular tutorials planned to suite learners and integrated environments to fasten learning and coding skills,, however most of this are locked behind the max,,,not even pro members get access to this,,, quite unsatisfying"
A Google user,5,Amazing
A Google user,5,I wish change the difficulty a bit.
A Google user,1,"I thought the app was nice, saw the web app, and thought I'd buy pro so I could make progress on both. Found out pro unlocks nothing on the web app, and my progress that I made on the free android version is locked on the web app even with pro. Stupid design"
A Google user,4,"Nice format. The app is missing the ability to test out of units that the learner already has a good grasp of. It could be my phone settings, but it seems like the editor aggressively selects text when I try to place the text cursor, specifically if nothing in the text editor window had already been selected. It takes 3-4 taps to get the cursor where I want it to go. Heaven help you if you are trying to add a line below the top line. Gets frustrating after a while."
A Google user,5,Where's termux🗿
A Google user,4,add the Ukrainian language pls🙏
A Google user,5,"brilliant I think I am getting better at Python ever since I wanted to learn how to code, and I love this app because it is so amazing to learn with. The developer is really helpful."

A Google user,5,it's good
A Google user,5,Its really good if you really want to learn. But ill enjoy it more if it was completly free
A Google user,5,👌💯💖😊
A Google user,3,learning is quite nice it gives u a sense of idea and gives good information 😜😜
A Google user,1,"When I finished ""conditional statements"" section in Python, next section should be ""Loops"", but it jump into ""Error and Exceptions"" section instead (when use portal), when I realize it, I already finished several part of this section, so when I want to ""Practice"", I should practice with section that I haven't learned yet, it so frustrating"
A Google user,5,"I did the free version of MiMo and was hooked. I've done coding in the past as a web designer, but this was fun, challenging, and refreshing. I'm 2 months into pro, on a +60 day streak, and I'm really enjoying it. This has been a great tool. I can only hope it will help build my qualifications and that people will view my work in this app as reputable."
A Google user,5,useful & can understand easily
A Google user,5,"I really enjoyed learning in your app, but can I please ask you to add Russian language, please add Russian language"
A Google user,5,"It is a nice app, but when i try to type the codes sometimes the typing goes to onther positions in the inspect where i do not want to type the code there, May you fix that problem but i really appreicate the great work of the app"
A Google user,5,"It's very user friendly, I used it for 20 minutes and I understand some of the basics of JavaScript."
A Google user,5,"After coming back to this app, it has gotten better."
A Google user,5,VERA LEVEL APP FOR AI
A Google user,5,good man I love it
A Google user,3,You can't learn anything from this app! It worked fine on the first day then the second it says everything i do is wrong even when i straight up use the solution and according to the ai tutor the code is correct but not to the app according to it there is something wrong. PLEASE fix this issue so i can learn. Till then 3 stars
A Google user,3,good 😊💯😊💯😊💯💯💯😊😊💯💯💯💯
A Google user,5,so useful. Great job!
A Google user,5,I'm learning alot
A Google user,5,good apps
A Google user,2,nice
A Google user,5,"it is easy, just like a game for me ~~)"
A Google user,5,"very good. highly recommended. only one problem though. I'm broke and can't get premium. I think that learning should never have a price added to it. though, I do understand that the developers have to make money, I still think that there shouldn't be a premium option. (just saying, the premium doesn't cost much, it's just that I'm not able to spend money online)"
A Google user,1,"Generally,I like the app. Why the one star review? Because companies keep getting away with these pricing schemes hoping that you won't notice some detail and then taking your money. I was offered PRO for half off of the year (limited time only, naturally), not realizing that MAX and PRO were different. PRO is just worse MAX and infinitely more expensive than basic (which is free). PRO doesn't need to exist as it doesn't offer anything over basic other than an IDE which I can get for free.1 star"
A Google user,5,Its an good app for beginners
A Google user,5,"love this app❤️ it is so cool😎, it makes things easier and less complicating and it's better than teachers"
A Google user,5,amazing 👏 I'm loving it so much it has detailed descriptions easy to understand 😀
A Google user,5,"This is an incredible app, it makes learning coding sooo easy, I've always wanted to learn how to code but I couldn't find out how but now I have this amazing app! I love it if you know absolutely NOTHING about coding, like me but want to learn, then get this app you'll learn how to code! Download this rn"
A Google user,5,Thank You for this app!
A Google user,5,it's really fun learning through this app
A Google user,5,I am literally learning at a comfortable pace. This is something I am willing to share with everyone. It's definitely a platform that I would recommend anyone willing to self learn coding to put into consideration.
A Google user,3,nice
A Google user,5,"I love this app, It teaches me to learn coding and proggraming faster! I I'm literally flexing my coding in my school. Maybe it would more better if there is a comment section on playgrounds, but it's still a great app."
A Google user,5,it's super great
A Google user,5,good
A Google user,5,This will help to create a game
A Google user,5,I think this app was too amazing bcz of that I learned coding well and it's free of cost so I recommended to use this app geart work developers
A Google user,4,"Courses are fast paced, simple and very clarifying. The UI could be more minimalistic with easier navigation. The dark mode scheme could be more eye-pleasing but the quality of this app is over the charts. Loved using this app to learn code and still do. Thanks"
A Google user,2,This is very good app to learn coding
A Google user,5,Great app

A Google user,5,I can learn code for this app
A Google user,5,best app ever and I love the streaks option it keeps me committed otherwise I would've forgotten that I've downloaded this app. haha. love it. I just wish they had a widget like the bird of Duolingo that sits on my phone screen to keep me more committed. and the notification option should also be more friendlier like Duolingo. thanks.
A Google user,4,learn in step while becoming a good problem solver but some path seems to get you wrong even when your right all is better with this app to become a programmer as well as a coder in python.
A Google user,5,This app is just MAGNIFICENT!
A Google user,5,"yes,it's good for learning data and basic to higher level programming to learn.a beginner to advanced level of the app,it's benefits for all people..."
A Google user,5,it's way cooler than I expected. see for yourself
A Google user,2,"I love the way Mimo presents information in bite-sized pieces! Unfortunately, Mimo has a heart system in place. Users learn through failure and punishing failure like that is counterproductive. Instead of focusing on learning, users have to focus on not making a mistake - learning nothing in the process. It makes learning a chore and unfun. Online, Youtube, and your local public library are better options if you legitimately want to learn coding / programming without limits."
A Google user,5,Very easy to learn step by step and it is super fun aswell!
A Google user,5,So good
A Google user,5,It's easy to use and fun. I recommend it
A Google user,5,"Power of knowledge, in the palm of my hand..."

A Google user,5,i like this friend very much 😍
A Google user,3,"I don't get, the app is nice and all but it's not loading on the web with PC despite my stable network. I have a project on python that requires I take it on PC buh for days the site refuse to load on the web. Fix this please!!!!"

A Google user,5,This app should be recommended to all university student studying IT
A Google user,5,"i think this app is awesome and fun.It is also the beat way to learn html as a beginner,Just wish it was an offline app"
A Google user,5,"It's pretty solid. Makes you think about what you're coding and how the code works. gives you knowledge, hands on practice, and a nice output that shows you what you coded. Also it reinforces the knowledge and skills you've gained. I haven't hit the paywall yet. Hopefully I can complete the topics with advertising."
A Google user,5,"Great app, esp for the total beginners."
A Google user,5,good app till now
A Google user,5,cornputer
A Google user,5,Bruh wonderful app

A Google user,5,Good application for learning; because it is easy
A Google user,5,very good for practicing for beginners
A Google user,4,Very amazing program so far. However I believe you should just take away the Mimo Pro and stick with the Mimo Max. Mimo Max is obviously the only way to get the most and all features and it makes Mimo Pro look useless and pointless in my observation. 👍 Overall great and will do an update in future.
A Google user,4,great learning platform! 😃 👍 🤖 mimo!!
A Google user,5,one of best app for learning coding basics !! :)
A Google user,5,Good for beginners especially when it comes to python learning!

A Google user,5,Nice way of teaching :)
A Google user,4,this is very cool but you should remove the heart feature
A Google user,4,"it's help me so much but if u wanna be pro abt it u need u pay it 😞 (im broke bro) anyways , as a beginner the important information they'll told u as detail as they can . but for me THAT'S SUPER DETAIL !! I CAN UNDERSTAND IT'S LESS THAN A MINUTE !!"

A Google user,5,A great app
A Google user,5,Mr.Mir
A Google user,4,Please add Arabic language
A Google user,5,works great and easy to learn with.
A Google user,5,"Mimo app is very interactive, easy to use and very explicit. Its simplicity and user- friendly environment is awesome."
A Google user,3,"Super goed concept, maar geen fan van de uitleg en vragen. Kan duidelijker en consistenter."
A Google user,4,it's the perfect app for anyone who wants to learn how to code especially if you have ADHD It is super interactive and instant the only fault with it is that the web version doesn't have the practice mode only the phone version does please bring it over I really love it.
A Google user,1,"my son deleted mimo cuz when he wanted to continue learning, but they wanted us to create a new account and they tried to hack us . (my son wrote this)"

A Google user,5,"I love the app already, it reminds me of Duolingo and it's a brilliant approach. I've used the app 7days straight now and it's definitely an amazing app to learn coding."
A Google user,1,"Geld Geld Geld Geld Geld Bevor ich sehe was es bietet Geld Geld Geld Geld Geld Geld Geld Geld Geld Geld Nein danke. Update: Antwort auf die Antwort Ihre behauptung das dass meiste gratis ist stimmt nicht, das einzigste was gratis ist ist ein Lehrgang das wahrscheinlich Java ist, wenn ich als Python jedoch nutze bringt mir ihre App absolut garnichts in der free version, unglaublich wie gierig dabei ist die App total simple aufgebaut, als würde man den Preis von Champagner für Wasser zahlen"
A Google user,5,So far so good. learning basic coding is fun and rewarding with this app. Very enjoyable
A Google user,4,so far it's a simple and competent app that is walking me through the basics at a steady pace
A Google user,5,So far so good. Hope they don't change it . Good initially for learning coding.
A Google user,5,good app for learning 👍
A Google user,4,great 👍
A Google user,4,This app is very good but my one problem is i think using f{} is outdated
A Google user,5,"Duolingo for code. Very early in it, but cute and very understandable so far."
A Google user,5,Perfect app for learning programming languages.
A Google user,5,an excellent app if you really want to learn code
A Google user,4,have to pay to get the full experience
A Google user,5,very educational
A Google user,5,"honestly makes learning super easy to understand, and has plenty of benefits to learning all these different kinds of coding"
A Google user,5,excellent
A Google user,5,Excellente! easy to follow and understand. Highly recommended!
A Google user,5,in my opinion add notes of the 10 answers in the round levels to the users to study
A Google user,5,"So far I really enjoy using Mimo! As a complete beginner, it is a very useful tool used alongside other materials, obviously."
A Google user,5,very good 😊 app
A Google user,5,that's a great source for beginners to start coding and app is very great &simple to use that's very helpful to me thanks for it &keep it up👍
A Google user,5,Busy learning how to be a Full-Stack Developer. The App is so remorseful to my brain. It teaches me like a 2yr old. Still on the HTML basics though
A Google user,5,"Not only app is great, but they also fixed a small bug very quickly and professionally when I reached out to them."
A Google user,5,Nice app and very useful for codeing

A Google user,5,good app
A Google user,5,Best app for learning programs and the pro is good to just invite the friend and get the pro for free not Like duolingo
A Google user,5,intresting
A Google user,1,"I got the $60 annual subscription and to do more than the first lesson it wanted me to spend more money to upgrade to the ""Max"" subscription. Nothing but a cash grab past that point"
A Google user,5,This app actually does teach you code in a fun and constructive way. best install I have ever done
A Google user,5,I love it
A Google user,5,well navigated through lesson with out having much effort to try to know which to learn first.
A Google user,5,ohhh YEAH
A Google user,5,love it. makes it fun to learn and exciting.
A Google user,5,Mimo is a very fun way to learn how to code
A Google user,4,super app
A Google user,4,I really haven't use this App yet. But from the reviews it doesn't hurt to try. I'm definitely not going to get the upgrade unless I know for sure that it's fun and easy to learn. Only because the upgrade is expensive.
A Google user,2,"There is no mention that this game costs money until after opening the app, answering some questions,and being told this is a FREE TRIAL, and that to get the real game I have to pay $60 bucks when it ends. I feel some heads up would have saved me the download time."
A Google user,5,very useful app
A Google user,5,Great app! Good explanations and fun.
A Google user,5,nice app
A Google user,5,It is duolingo but for coding.
A Google user,3,the teaching instructional method is ok
A Google user,5,I have learned alot
A Google user,5,cool
A Google user,5,You can learn the basics easily
A Google user,5,An easy way to learn coding.
A Google user,5,"I'm learning HTML and it's really fun! I started yesterday and can now create headings in 6 fonts, bold and italic text, buttons, and more. The only downside is that I don't get to type much—often, the code is already typed and broaken into multiple pieces and i have to put it together, like a puzzle. While it’s easier than typing from scratch, I think I’d remember it better if I could type out more of the code myself."
A Google user,4,this is a very good experience
A Google user,5,splendid
A Google user,3,it is not free at all but it is good to learn programming
A Google user,5,"10/10 *This has helped me so much, It's amazing *"

A Google user,5,I love this app. Is the best. You can actually learn coding with this app. Google play store please give access to more than 5 stars. This app deserves more than 5 stars.
A Google user,5,Why I can't learn JavaScript & python at the same time
A Google user,5,I love this app. It makes learning so easy and makes me wanna learn nonstop. So guys......choose Mimo for your learning
A Google user,5,I thought I wouldn't be in the app more than 5-10m but I did 1h easy without knowing it's easy to understand an to learn. I love this app ❤️
A Google user,5,I jutst started and is very interesting and interactive
A Google user,5,"I am having a lot of fun, this is like DuoLingo for coding!"

A Google user,5,the best app for beginners
A Google user,5,"love the step by step repetition, great for learning, also the fun sounds and funny little mascot guy actually helps alot ."
A Google user,2,"Refilled my hearts and still had to completely start over. Tapping randomly highlights text when it should just drop the cursor there. Holding should highlight text. Can be so frustrating I'll just let it delete what's highlighted and retype the provided boilerplate. Also, in the middle of typing code the cursor randomly shoots up and continues typing into line 1. Gg. Sololearn is better when it comes to the mobile typing experience, but Mimo has better content."
A Google user,5,very nice and easy learn
A Google user,5,"It's great and fun to learn with Mimo, worth giving it a shot ✨"
A Google user,5,Would been great if there is c++. Learning for arduino.

A Google user,5,It's one of the best programming apps I've ever used
A Google user,5,excellent app to learn
A Google user,5,"This app is a great app to learn coding for beginners! it follows the ""Duolingo"" sort of way of teaching and is super easy to understand. It also has streaks to record your progress. I recommend using this app rather than YouTube tutorials for coding as this app provides you with many coding challenges along your journey that keeps you engaged. You only have to give 5 to 20 minutes of your daily time to this app and you will definitely learn coding faster and understand the concept better."
A Google user,5,helpful in python
A Google user,4,it's nice app to learn coding but you need to be consistence with this app they help you to learn coding step by step ☺☺

A Google user,1,Bad app. It's not free. Instead use codefobe. It's good. This app gets hang also.
A Google user,1,"********************* YOU START BY LYING. ********************* The most important thing to get trusted is to be honest (obviously), mimo start by making you believe that it's TOTALLY FREE, which it's not. I found it interesting because of the advertisement saying that it's totally free, then I put on it some trust and my precious time, after installing it, *immediately* i figured out that it's ACTUALLY NOT FREE. It's just another scam to attract us with a false idea, I DELETED IT IMMEDIATELY."
A Google user,5,I've learned a lot on this app so far.
A Google user,5,"This app is a very good app, it made me a very brilliant python programer"

A Google user,5,i learn more from this app than at school. a very great tool in learning coding!
A Google user,5,just super
A Google user,5,Mimo really helps me in learning coding in a fun and better way! Thanks Mimo!
A Google user,4,Good app for developer
A Google user,3,Not for the intermediate user. I wanted to improve my python skills but you have to go through the whole beginner levels and they are endless! The user interface is nice in that they make it easy for you to type on the phone. Not into the whole gamification thing.
A Google user,5,it's were good app and useful
A Google user,3,"very good app but has some stability issues.sometimes when i use the playground it refreshes the app and it takes me to the 1st lesson of the chapter.If it was more affordable i would buy this app,but i am a student and for me it's just too much and it's a monthly subscription app so i am not happy with it.If this app had a one time purchase i would buy it.Good app but expensive and has some bugs in it,fix this please"
A Google user,5,For now it works fine and the learning process is well enough.
A Google user,5,it’s just nice to learn coding by this app mimo.god bless you .. ......

A Google user,5,a bit hards because there's no explanation when i do wrong about the coding
A Google user,4,"everything great except the subscription, it just too expensive for me"
A Google user,4,this app is actually one of the best so far thanks very much
A Google user,5,Highly recommended for beginners
A Google user,5,so far it's very simple and direct. I'm 32 with no prior knowledge and I am starting to understand just after 20min. I believe I'll know how to code after completion. great for kids and adults. also interactive
A Google user,5,as a beginner this app is so fk helpful

A Google user,3,fair
A Google user,3,"It lets you enter a world of coding with everything clear at first but then asks for a max subscription for doing challenges on desktop and doesn't even allow those challenges to be solved on mobile, so what's the us if you can't practically learn it!!!????😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬😠😠😠"
A Google user,5,This is best app for software engineer
A Google user,5,it's nice
A Google user,5,"Hi mimo I can't sign up for new account, it said the account is already in use. I don't know what's happening pls fix that."

A Google user,3,"Frustrating, was clipping along with the Python path and the Rock, Paper, Scissors exercise says to get on the computer to access webpage to continue. The website doesn't interact with me by not allowing me to select the project."
A Google user,5,this is a nice app to understand coding
A Google user,5,Loving it
A Google user,5,Its good
A Google user,2,It's stupidity to break a user's progress if a user did previously learned lessons instead of new ones.
A Google user,5,The best coding app
A Google user,3,it's quite easy to get and so helpful but i still think the heats should increase tho
A Google user,5,"This app made my coding journey effortless and enjoyable. I'm deeply grateful for the meaningful, engaging exercises and use-case-based knowledge that helped me grasp coding concepts.

A Google user,4,it's better than I expected it u should definitely try it out
A Google user,5,If you can't read the this isn't for you.
A Google user,3,I've completed four contents and then I've quit the app. After 20 mins when I again enter the app it tells me to start from the beginning. And I can't get back to my progress level. Why is this happening? Although the lessons are effective. But this problem won't let me progress. The developers should fix it.
A Google user,5,Incredible.
A Google user,5,excellent
A Google user,5,too good I love it from Fiji 🇫🇯
A Google user,4,seems okay so far
A Google user,5,Interesting and captivating

A Google user,5,best for learner
A Google user,5,loved it
A Google user,1,"This app I think don't deserve for 1 star also, because of its subscription policy. I think the rates are too high. Guys if you want to purchase subscription go for max because it gives access to mimo web also that is you can also unlock the couse contents in desktop this is the far most best."
A Google user,5,Very good app.
A Google user,5,very thorough. easy to interact with.
A Google user,5,It's very helpful
A Google user,5,"This is my first time working with HTML and this app is making it super simple, love it."
A Google user,3,nice but that certificate we have to pay but if it will be free than the app is were nice 🙂
A Google user,3,"it's a great app to keep practicing daily with their coding lessons, I hope to see more of real life scenario based adavanced challenges with further updates, but there is a serious issue with the app, an advanced learner can't jump to next modules but they need to complete each and every lesson in the module to move forth, Consider having a feature by which a module can be completed with an assessment which includes all types of questions from the module,"
A Google user,5,it's nice and easy I love it
A Google user,5,I love it
A Google user,4,noice wee meed more course's like Microsoft word.

A Google user,5,that app is the best at learning I am obsessed with it now

A Google user,4,a little pricy
A Google user,5,"great for beginners and pros alike, reasonable yearly subscription, only problem lost my login so lost all of my progress, great and versatile app would highly recommended."
A Google user,1,Installed it. Got to the point where I was supposed to type a city name. My keyboard would not come up on the screen no matter what I tried so this is useless to me.

A Google user,5,"This app is worth the time for learning. As a programming novice, I've used it for over a month and learned a lot. Although some lesson and question structures were a bit confusing, and the examples sometimes difficult to grasp, I managed with outside AI assistance. There’s always room for improvement, and I hope this app continues to make a positive impact."
A Google user,5,goated

A Google user,4,Nice 👍🙂👍
A Google user,5,This app is great for beginners.
A Google user,5,best app in the world
A Google user,5,Nice interactive learning app. Good approach. Must try.
A Google user,4,All I can say is that. This is helping me a lot... but please if you can add video lesson probably live for premium (paid)
A Google user,2,"Not worth it without premium. Getting a breakdown of what you're doing/what you're doing wrong is only for paying users. The handful of free hints and explanations I got were helpful, but once they were out I was flying blind. When I got confused I was basically hitting buttons at random and eventually just being told the answer. Coding is more logic and puzzle solving than plain memorization, so that's just not a viable learning method."
A Google user,5,Its really good... im personally suggesting u to experience it... it's really helpful for me
A Google user,5,Supercool app it's good app
A Google user,5,an excellent app
A Google user,3,could have more features for the free version

A Google user,5,Easy to learn 😊😊
A Google user,5,Nice app and good for learning
A Google user,4,"Excellent app but needed widget system to remind us to play daily, can check Duolingo's implementation"
A Google user,5,is it so useful
A Google user,5,Super helpful app to freshen my mind and reignite my passion for coding!
A Google user,5,great learning app
A Google user,3,it was an nice application for learn coding but when I download it shows the virus 🦠🦟 in the application
A Google user,4,"As a scratch noob, this app was very helpful with it's Duolingo like coding tutorials."
A Google user,2,"After completing a level, when sparks is being calculated, it shows a false error message regarding no internet connection even when the internet connection is up and running. Because of this error we have to complete the same level again, which is quite frustrating and time consuming."
A Google user,5,Beautiful
A Google user,3,it's very easy to use and helps you go through everything you have learned so you can't forget them
A Google user,5,"I like this app because it teaches you to code in simple English . A beginner easily understands and remembers the exercises done after each lesson and also because the exercises or practices are in line with the topics you just covered. I've been looking for an app to learn, and this is helpful compared to others I have tried as a beginner."
A Google user,5,"I went through 10 apps before I found this one, totally worth it! Thank you From someone that knows absolutely nothing, this app is so straightforward and its even in a dark mode! Great"

A Google user,5,best
A Google user,5,Great way of learning.

A Google user,5,it makes coding very easy and fun to learn and understand better. thank you 👍
A Google user,5,This app will teach you morethan any tutor can teach you about programing its amazin 10/10
A Google user,4,hi hi
A Google user,5,I think it is the best app for youngest to run and code programming language
A Google user,5,this app is awesome
A Google user,5,Phenomenal simple app that has inspired me to dive deeper into coding. Interactive and enjoyable learning experience. Thanks! 💕 Brilliant coders who made this app!
A Google user,5,very helpful
A Google user,5,An easy to understand entry to the world of coding.
A Google user,5,Very fun and easy way to start learning code!!
A Google user,5,Very nice 👌
A Google user,5,easy to understand
A Google user,5,EASY AND INTERESTING
A Google user,5,it's a very good app it can teaches you to become professionals on technology's so everyone who want's to download the mimo app it can help you get to your goals
A Google user,5,"one stop solution for learning html or full stack developer, literally they spend time on making the user understand the concept, it shows the same problems with solutions again and again so the user could fully understand it , even the school kids can learn from it , very helpful 🙏"
A Google user,3,"Come on, do I really need to pay to unlock the full course lesson???!!!??!?!!"
A Google user,4,it cool for starting your own app
A Google user,2,"First impressions are REALLY good, but after 10 minutes I slowly started hating it, even when I chose the highest level it started teaching me beginners stuff, so I thought ""eh I'll just the playground"", it started of good but it started getting unusable. The main problem for me is the indentation and it's really frustrating. It's definitely not worth so much paying for."
A Google user,5,This app is awesome for coding for beginners
A Google user,5,"While this decision may be considered rash since I just started, the entire experience is a lovely one. I just love having to open my phones, to learn a language on Duolingo and how to code on Mimo. it's like I don't have to go to Instagram or TikTok anymore. Thank you, Mimo."
A Google user,5,best gamified learning
A Google user,3,"Mimo is great for learning to code, but it could be even better with a few additions. Advanced courses in areas like machine learning and cybersecurity would help users gain deeper knowledge. Real-world projects would provide practical experience, while personalized learning paths ensure a tailored learning journey. Instant feedback on strengths and weaknesses would help learners improve more effectively. These additions would make Mimo even more valuable for future developers."
A Google user,5,a very nice app.
A Google user,5,its been a fun way to learn to code
A Google user,5,very helpful
A Google user,5,I think it's a best app for learning that I ever seen
A Google user,5,cool app
A Google user,5,"I highly recommend Mimo as it's incredibly easy to use, interactive, and very user-friendly. I've noticed some negative feedback, but I believe that's often due to people expecting everything for free. The developers behind Mimo deserve support to maintain and improve the app. Mimo offers three plans: a free basic plan, the Pro plan, and the Max plan. The Max plan is the top-tier premium option, providing access to everything you might need. It's well worth it for the features and value it offer"
A Google user,3,good
A Google user,5,Great learning app
A Google user,5,"great for introducing programming, if you are experienced this app is not much of help besides refreshing memory."
A Google user,5,very supe Please Mimo go like this
A Google user,5,it's too good to learn coding on the phone
A Google user,1,Iam very interested to learn coding
A Google user,3,SQL course is too slow paced and lengthy.
A Google user,5,"Heya Lovin the app but I'm getting error while purchasing premium please look into it, It's showing error - Initiation mode should be present and value ( 00-14 )"
A Google user,5,it's nice but pro is too expensive for kids like me.
A Google user,5,"I learn HTML basics in 3 days 5 min per day for free , it's really amazing."
A Google user,5,if you want to improve your programming skill mimo app is a good choice 👌.
A Google user,5,This app is really fun and easy to use...it feels like I'm playing a game...they developers made it interesting while learning...Good job developers
A Google user,2,ooooooooôoooo
A Google user,5,I give it 5 Star because it is user friendly and easy to use This is a great choice if you want to learn coding and how to implement what you have learned
A Google user,5,"basicly the duolingo of codings, i really like the way it teaches how to code, simple and effective, and that's all that matters"

A Google user,5,great app.... subscribe to it
A Google user,5,perfect 👍
A Google user,5,Excelente
A Google user,5,I like this app. It's fun to use because you can learn about coding computers. I suggest to high school students like me to use it so that when you enter college you already have a little knowledge about coding computers.
A Google user,5,"This app makes it easy to learn code, it basically spoon feeds it to you.
*I never would have thought I'd be able to learn things this complicated this fast.*
*I'm considering paying for the year, this app is something else.*
I tried using a little bit of code I just finished learning for this review. They should have this app in schools, it starts you off by how much you know and in my case 0%"
A Google user,2,"Frustrating Limitations of PC Subscription: A Missed Opportunity I've had mixed experiences with my recent subscription, which linitially thought would offer a complete, streamlined experience across all devices-especially my PC. While the subscription grants access to great content, there are significant limitations on the PC version that hold it back, making it feel like a half-baked experience."
A Google user,5,Best
A Google user,5,good app
A Google user,1,Took multiple attempts to log in. Progress and career path were reset when i did. Now progress won't reset. Card was charged $60 which would have been worth it based on the free trial experience but the app is too buggy to use. Scam.

A Google user,5,excellent app for learning coding
A Google user,1,"Only the first ""chapter"" is free and the first chapter is about tags. Like super basic. Even tho it has ads, so many, the free version is just useless."
A Google user,5,"The Mimo coding app has been a daily companion in my coding journey, offering a user-friendly platform to learn and practice coding skills. Its structured lessons and interactive challenges have significantly contributed to my understanding of programming concepts. I appreciate the app's approach to teaching, which makes learning to code accessible and enjoyable. Therefore, I wholeheartedly give Mimo a 5-star rating for its exceptional educational experience."

A Google user,4,easy to use and fun to learn with but I don't like how somethings are locked away by the subscription
A Google user,5,gooood
A Google user,5,I like this app. It was my dream to learn coding. I don't need even money to learn coding. You should make apps like this always. Thank you app developer.
A Google user,5,I am new to this. And it's really fun
A Google user,5,one of the best platform to learn codes
A Google user,5,Oh my God. This is totally Awesome. Just Amazing 🥹. I don't know how to thankyou. I just started it and I don't know about later but right now it is the best app to learn. Do you have the same app for other subjects. Also it would be great if there were theory answers too you know. Like you know descriptions and definitions
A Google user,5,🤌🤌🤌
A Google user,5,"I've Give it 5 Stars, Cz all apps that teach you something they should be at the first list on the app store, they deserve everything even if we can't subscribe to the pro version, we can add a nice comment and positive feedbacks, and watch ads to make the app and developers continue they work, so thank you so much for this lovely app"
A Google user,1,"It's paid app, without paying to there subscription you can't do anything. In 2.5K amount I can search similar app and certifications"
A Google user,5,i love this app
A Google user,5,"Very good for coding begginers. I tried this out because it looked similar to Duolingo, they're practically the same but Duo is for language and Mimo is for coding. It's so fun to the point I see it more as a game than a educational app."
A Google user,5,Hey mimo I have made google account before then delete that was python but when I install again and chose html and google account it's not making it it says to contact
A Google user,5,Great
A Google user,5,nice platform
A Google user,5,it's really great and easy
A Google user,5,Very helpful
A Google user,5,really enjoy it. great productive way to kill share time at work haha
A Google user,5,Simply First time Experience With 5-Stars.
A Google user,5,it's just like Duolingo but for coding. I really enjoy coding on mimo
A Google user,5,Es muy práctica y me ayuda a refrescar conocimientos 👍
A Google user,4,"it's really good, they give you some tutorial to try it"
A Google user,3,"I'm new, and I do not see the script called Luau. The one used in roblox scripts, unfortunately. But I still think the journey will be fun learning the other types of scripting :]."
A Google user,5,It is very important
A Google user,5,Best Game ever seen in Play Store
A Google user,5,This learning app is so down to earth and anyone can learn with ease. I recommend this even for children
A Google user,5,it is helping me learn coding fast
A Google user,5,This is a good idea 💡 to learn from Mimo if you want to become coding 👌🌟
A Google user,3,It used to be a good app now it's suddnely refusing to work
A Google user,5,Great app for learning so far!!
A Google user,5,"Nice, faster way to learn web development."
A Google user,5,I like this program it is a large language model that can cover multiple problems at one time i think I want to learn how to be a master coder i cannot load it for no apparent i will go to Barnes & Nobles about multiple books on coding
A Google user,1,Just look up free tutorials on whichever language you're interested in learning. This thing wants to charge you R$200 a year for glorified Duolingo
A Google user,5,very nice quiz game to learn html. but I was very disappointed for one thing that you dont teach. hope so you will do better. all the best I am one of the most regular and descent user of mimo thank you
A Google user,5,very easy to learn coding with mimo
A Google user,5,works
A Google user,5,"I've only been playing for about twenty minutes and I think it's too early for me to review the app. from what I've seen so far though, it's quite nice. Hence three stars. Update: I've been playing for a few weeks now and I've actually got a 16 day streak going. The app is great. I'm still having a lot of fun and it makes learning to code pretty straight forward as far as I can tell"
A Google user,4,useful 💯
A Google user,5,Best app but please also make an app for python coding.
A Google user,5,This app insen and best to learn coding. •The user use this
A Google user,5,Thanks mimo developers for this coding learning machine
A Google user,1,friends invite for free try for 2 weeks doesn't work
A Google user,5,Very nice app. learnt a lot
A Google user,5,"It's a good app. However, I think waiting for the heart is way too long. So I suggest a practice to earn one or reduce the cooldown in the next update. Thank you."
A Google user,4,It should be free
A Google user,5,App is completely different and easy to learn .
A Google user,5,nice app
A Google user,5,good
A Google user,1,why can't I finish the first round
A Google user,5,"Yes,this app is very wonderful to work and one word to say MIMO app on fire💥💥."
A Google user,5,I don't need any pro version this is all I need to persue in my career(Besides the essential stuff)
A Google user,5,outstanding
A Google user,5,Best app to learn coding on the entire Market I've seen so far.
A Google user,3,"I try to upgrade to the max subscription and it worked on an account email account that I don't even use. I lost the fourteen day trial somehow and I'm still in the proversion and as long as I still get reimbursed , confirm that ill get my 14 days trial and i will change my review. EDIT: they seem to have granted my main account max but I have no details on time frame or reimbursement. Adding a star."
A Google user,4,Add streak saving option..
A Google user,4,it's good to learn something html
A Google user,5,so useful and i like it 👍🔥❤️
A Google user,3,"Highly desirable app for coding... i wanted to request you to add one more coding path which is ""node js"" in the coding section... Happy coding 😺"
A Google user,5,The UI is clean. The paths are easy to follow. Having achievements and rankings make it fun and compatible especially if you have started with friends. The entire experience for me so far has been much more than expected. The bite-size delivery system makes it much more easier to pause and resume later if needed.
A Google user,5,"MIMO is a fantastic app for learning coding and development! The features are well-designed, and I love how user-friendly it is. Each lesson is broken down into simple, easy-to-follow tasks that make complex topics feel approachable. The app’s design keeps me engaged, and I find myself looking forward to each new lesson. Perfect for beginners and anyone looking to refresh their skills. Highly recommend MIMO for anyone wanting to learn coding with ease and at their own pace!"
A Google user,5,Good
A Google user,4,I think it's a great app for learning coding in a fun way. (Genuine opinion)
A Google user,5,Great app
A Google user,4,great APK excellent coding lessons but if they could exclude the hearts and the premium that they want to make people buy it could be the next big thing
A Google user,5,"Content is easy to follow, structure makes it easy to retain and the examples provided can be taken and applied in a test environment so you can see it in action twice; in the app and trying it yourself. Has a bit of the Duolingo structure, which I appreciate a lot, all in all, great app."
A Google user,4,Very Educational tool
A Google user,3,the pro very expensive
A Google user,3,"So far l am loving, it's perfect. it does not require going to a cyber cafe to learn and it's self explanatory"
A Google user,5,I love the interaction with the app it is making learning fun.

A Google user,5,It is very help me learn coding
A Google user,4,fun learning
A Google user,3,good app
A Google user,2,Limited features and resources not worthy of downloading
A Google user,5,in my opinion it is best for the teenagers (13-19) to learn coding. it can be for fun or for your career. I'm 13 y/o and I'm learning so much from this and the best thing is you ca learn coding in your PHONE!! respect to developers 💪
A Google user,5,this may be the greatest coding app ever in the world 🗺 🤯🤯🤯🤯mind blowing
A Google user,5,cool way to learn the technical skills while we've free time and the ui is very nice and cool and it inspire me with new ideas... it's a good start for everyone who wants to learn and build technical skills... thanks Mimo.. and it's team... need more with different technologies to learn with it and expecting a AI interaction like AI tutor or mentor..

A Google user,5,I can't take my streak challenge rewards
A Google user,5,very nice for starters to get the fundamentals taught
A Google user,5,"I like that it gives me a decent amount of test questions while learning the Syntax. Letting me interact with every lesson instead of just reading it makes it easier for me to visualize and memorize it better. I recently came back to this app to give it another try at self teaching myself, and this app makes it enjoyable and easy. Great app overall, and the way each lesson is done, just 🤌🤌."
A Google user,4,"This app is great, but I think it could be improved with a feature that prevents streaks from breaking occasionally."
A Google user,5,It's the best
A Google user,5,really love how easy it is to learn with Mimo!

A Google user,5,I just love this app
A Google user,4,"it's my first time learning how to code,look easy with this app. I love this app."
A Google user,5,Mimo is a really great way not only to learn but also have fun doing it! I'm currently on my 115 day streak and still going! :)
A Google user,5,good for programming
A Google user,5,"Its Great something to learn completely alien to me 

=""LOOK MOM NO HANDS""==""because I like my text to be large""/>"
A Google user,5,"As someone who knows nothing about code, I am enjoying the app so far. It seems helpful and very basic to begin learning. Each section is interactive and the app is a lot like Duolingo but for coding."
A Google user,5,"This app is really helpful for beginners like me to learn coding languages. However, as a student, I find it a bit expensive to afford. I know many other students who are interested in learning but can’t pay the full amount. It would be great if you could consider lowering the fees for students or maybe offer a more affordable annual plan. Even providing free access for students for a limited time could make a big difference. This would help a lot of us who want to learn but are limited by money"
A Google user,4,Nice app
A Google user,5,great thing
A Google user,2,Everything is great...the ui the design and all but i dont know why people are only focused on and around web dev...theres a thing called app dev...you should have added that..if not that at least you could have added java .
A Google user,3,"Give me a line break with this app, started to brrr after using it"
A Google user,5,"I just love this app because it breaks all this complex stuff you won't understand in the school down to basic language, thumbs up to the person who had the idea for the app"
A Google user,5,pretty cool app to learn coding
A Google user,5,great app!!
A Google user,4,5/5 if it had offline support .. What if u showed me ads instead of me not using the app for 3 hours?
A Google user,5,I well enjoyed and easy to learn and ican understand easily
A Google user,5,Good
A Google user,5,Good app. Very friendly to use in learning coding.
A Google user,4,better than a YouTube tutorial

A Google user,5,SO FAR IM LEARNING YAY!
A Google user,2,"Eh, money do everything, so sad."
A Google user,5,"Very Good application for beginners to learn coding to basic level but please add new special option of different single language how to can code , I hope you are understand."
A Google user,5,good 👍
A Google user,5,overall good
A Google user,5,XC. Great app
A Google user,4,good app for learning programing skills but it doesn't have voice feature le ke duolingo
A Google user,5,❤️
A Google user,5,"I was a former Cloud Engineer before and in between contracts thought I should learn to code a bit better because I only had experience with bash and PowerShell, plus I don't wanna be on Operations anymore. I'm currently doing the Full Stack Dev option and so far it's been so good. It's interactive and builds you up a little by a little. They use scaffolding method of teaching which is it pushes you a bit further by building on previous concept you learn. This app makes too darn easy to learn."
A Google user,5,I love it
A Google user,3,As of now it's ok to use this app. I injoy using it.
A Google user,5,"Can i offer you some features that i would like? A place for notes, A section for games to do something else for 10 minutes without leaving from the app."
A Google user,4,I love it
A Google user,5,"Just got started in refreshing my beginner knowledge, when i started coding i became so discouraged but not mimo gives me more motivation"
A Google user,3,I think it is great for learning but have come to learn that I am not liked in the coding world for my Atlantean religious books I read. And do not really find a lot of motivation to learn coding because of the request from codecademy to repeat a project from memory based on the private project on Mimo. I figure Mimo and codecademy have some kind of communication being coding learning platforms still great opportunities both of them
A Google user,5,Best app to learn coding
A Google user,5,very helpful
A Google user,4,"Quite nice , but mine stopped opening again, plz fix this problem"
A Google user,5,Issue resolved. Thanks to the devs for their help.
A Google user,5,very cute
A Google user,4,"I tried the app but unfortunately I don't see any course for C++ which I really needed. Overall, it's a great app and I highly recommend it if you want to learn Javascript or Python and it's really easy to use."
A Google user,4,"this has been a great app! I even paid for the max subscription, but there are some minor things that differ between the desktop web app and the mobile app. using the mobile is great for doing practice while out and about. I would recommend using mimo for learning to code if you're new."
A Google user,5,this is too good
A Google user,5,Great app
A Google user,5,"really good and helps you learn, I think Pro subscription is worth it but mimo max is not but udu"
A Google user,5,very nice learning platform.
A Google user,5,love the coding experience
A Google user,4,Easier to learn for every interested coding person.... I like this app
A Google user,5,Learned one free coding course and had MySpace in my youth - I was convinced I could code. But this app makes learning easy and accessible.
A Google user,5,When I find way to learn coding on android phone on online i find mimo and I give it try and i find it mimo best app for learning
A Google user,4,This is very useful and safe.
A Google user,3,very easy to use
A Google user,5,😃
A Google user,5,great for learning code
A Google user,4,"just a beginner but I think I'm getting a hang of it, though it seems though, the design is learner- friendly"
A Google user,5,I don't know I think I'm learning
A Google user,5,coding is becoming my favorite thing
A Google user,4,Pretty Cool!
A Google user,5,"exceptional coding app, easy to learn. But I think the English in it is somehow difficult for beginners"
A Google user,5,top
A Google user,5,good for everyone 👍
A Google user,1,"SCAM. I cancelled my subscription many months ago, and they've taken 250 pounds out of my bank account. Don't put any of your card details in the app as they'll take money from you even when you've cancelled your subscription 6 months in advance and haven't used it at all."
A Google user,5,Can you add c language and c++ course in mimo app
A Google user,5,good app
A Google user,5,Good
A Google user,5,It's kinda worthy app to learn the basics of coding. I suggest i very much to all of them who wants to learn about coding.
A Google user,5,Easy to learn
A Google user,5,super
A Google user,5,fun way to learn
A Google user,1,"Pathetic and expensive. It's an app that offers a few days of free service, then charges you €50+ for a year's subscription, with no reminders. I despise this practise for a start, but then the learning material is very, very slow. It suggests that it will teach you AI and professional coding. This is nonsense. The game like method of training is incredibly slow and very, very basic. Seriously, just get a Udemy course for ~€20. You'll have it for life, and leave this for the suckers."
A Google user,5,A very very good app for learning coding
A Google user,1,"Top basic,couldnt seem to skip over the basics either"
A Google user,5,the best coding app to learn coding on mobile and star earning
A Google user,5,thought me to master variables and printing
A Google user,4,"if you have enough money for subscription, then this is a great app"
A Google user,5,so easy and slick to use.
A Google user,5,"ajuda muito, recomendo"
A Google user,5,I love this app. learn is made Simple
A Google user,5,"This app has a fun way of learning code. Sometimes when I put in something that works, I lose a heart. It turns out the solution needs to be small version of code to be correct."
A Google user,1,"Why do you need to pay to complete the course? Isn't that what learning apps are for? Would have rated 4-5 stars, but needing to buy premium to even finish the courses is insane. Take a more Duolingo approach and allow the user to complete the courses with ads and extra stuff and no ads in premium."
A Google user,5,"awesome, feels like a pro in minutes"
A Google user,5,"Okay, time to write my review. Holly molly. This app is amazing! I've been learning to program on it for the last month and I've managed to make a site that shows Hello, World! with a button linked to my facebook profile with some simple styling after two weeks. Context: I had zero programing knowledge. It's easy to understand, has all the key knowledge stuffed into interactive learning enviroment and I really had no idea how fun it is to study like this 😁 100/10 🎉"
A Google user,5,pretty good got the trial. planning to cancel but so far im getting my moneys worth so might just keep it
A Google user,5,Helpful
A Google user,5,Hacker x having good skill in coding.
A Google user,5,great
A Google user,5,wow
A Google user,3,"I wanted to learn,but you HAVE to sign up for a free trial,it looked fun.but no"
A Google user,5,"excelente aplicación la recomiendo, es muy buena para aprender a programar."
A Google user,5,easy to learn and worth the price for how much it teaches and certifies.
A Google user,5,great app reminds me of Duolingo
A Google user,2,"This app is bad, i asked to learn game programing and now im learning how to make my own useless website, plus the images dont work at all, its still quite fun so i rate it a 2/5, i only recommend if your doing it for fun because you definitely cant become a professional from this"
A Google user,5,"its really good, like duolingo for coding"
A Google user,5,"it is a very good app,it serves as practice and also gaming. It is quite fun."
A Google user,4,good for learning but we should pay money for certificates
A Google user,5,it's a very nice app for beginners and also experts
A Google user,5,helping me more with code
A Google user,4,It is really useful and easy to understand.
A Google user,4,"I think the app is very good. One issue i hit is when I'm typing an answer, often the cursor jumps to the beginning of the code and it starts typing there. Otherwise, I find a decent amount of the practice or class work repetitive."
A Google user,2,"When it works, it's incredible. However the Android version has an error where the ""practice"" section doesn't work. I have to use my iPhone to use the full functionality of the app."
A Google user,4,"progressing well for me so, I think everyone should try it if they want to learn html"
A Google user,5,it's a fantastic app that teaches you how code easily using Python.
A Google user,5,the app is really interesting for programers

A Google user,5,a good app for learn coding but one thing they have to give us a practice web page to conquer our skills
A Google user,4,Best app to learn programming as a beginner
A Google user,5,I am a high schooler who is not very into coding. But I think it looks cool and find it interesting how it works. The UI is so cool! And you can access SO MANY things for absolutely free! It is really very good who want to learn coding just for fun!
A Google user,4,"I love using this app to learn Python. It's become part of my daily activities. The lessons are structured and easy to follow. Even as a slow learner, I am able to grasp the concepts and reflect on my learning. It's a very interactive and user-friendly app and I highly recommend it to newbies, like myself. Please add more details to the Glossary section, especially for Python?"

A Google user,5,it's cool
A Google user,5,Just one word Best application for learning programing.
A Google user,4,"It's a nice app. Gives a lot for people to learn. Would definitely recommend. The only problem is that it has the most important feature - desktop projects, locked behind the heavy pay wall. And it is not possible for a student like me to purchase something like that just for desktop projects. So yeah. I'm trying to manage by doing that stuff by myself as much as I can, but I can clearly see that I'm definitely lacking out. I'd be grateful if they kept Desktop projects as separate pay option."

Thanku mimo . Love you from my heart ❤️❤️❤️

A Google user,4,"I've practiced at least 1 lesson per day and reached a 56 day streak and I haven't paid for a single thing. The heart system is fair, ads are minimal and non-invasive, and I enjoy myself while I learn because each question gives immediate feedback. Versus other free resources which simply haven't been engaging enough for my ADHD to come back to. The design is beautiful, the app and browser versions both function smoothely, and I love that the coins you earn buy rest days for the streak."
A Google user,5,"I have been using Mimo for a long time, the lessons are simple, the basics will stick, its easy enough to feel like a game, and fun enough you will want to keep playing. If you only ""play"" when your in the bathroom, waiting at the bus stop or have a moment waiting for the kettle, you will learn something new every time."
A Google user,5,amazing wow 😲😲 making it easy to get
A Google user,5,So far so good.
A Google user,5,I like this app because when you get it wrong the app will correct you and it's helping me learning how to code and very soon I'll be making website's and make my YouTube channel website once I am certified to do so and my uncle and aunty will be proud of me for only being young but I am certified to code and create website because I want to become a great scientist and teach me how to create website's and this is so great to learn how to code and create website's so I rate it 5stars forhelp

Had changed to a different device and now the app has moved me to a completely different path and doesn't have anything saved from the path I was on with my previous device, meaning all progress was lost. Will be ending my subscription because of this."
A Google user,5,The interactive nature is very commendable
A Google user,5,because it's easy fun and it has a little cute robot to it. 😁😁😄

A Google user,5,good 💯 but ♥️ is provide 6 to 8
A Google user,5,"man this app is awesome, reminds me of sololearn but better! Also python is easy to learn I think lol so far anyway it seems more understandable than JavaScript to me"
A Google user,5,"really good, explains code in a way that actually helps u understand it"
A Google user,5,It's such an amazing app it helps me to learn a unique way to learn coding It is a great platform..
A Google user,5,"Honestly, I was skeptical until my first few lessons, then I was hooked on Mimo. I tell everyone about it that is even remotely interested in coding. It is fun and bitesized. Best of all, I'm not forced into buying anything. I can try everything out at my own pace. I will be getting Mimo Max, though, because it is worth it. Mimo is coding made fun."
A Google user,4,"When working on longer format questions, the cursor tends to jump to the top, and the page tends to scroll to the bottom. This is a bit frustrating. Edit: I thought I'd be able to use the desktop app with the subscription. You get the first chapter of lessons then it locks down. A bit misleading."
A Google user,4,Awesome app...I recommend it to any code learning person
A Google user,5,"Amazing learning app, extremely easy and friendly interface. Best app for learning basics."
A Google user,5,excellent app to learn about Python and code!
A Google user,5,"it helped me so much,Thanks!"

A Google user,5,just excellent💯💯💯💯💯
A Google user,1,"The app needs optimization for tablets, right now I'm using Tab S9+ and it works so poor. There are some bugs while trying to write codes (this sometimes happen in the phone app too) and the apperance seems really weird it does not really fit the tablet screen."
A Google user,5,Amazing

A Google user,5,the best for beginner.. thank you mimo
A Google user,4,nice app for learning purpose
A Google user,5,The app is a actually really nice but the only thing I don't like is that it is not giving us the opportunity to write codes. we are just selecting. It would have been perfect if we are given out opportunity to write codes in every lesson or course learnt
A Google user,5,best learning for Coding
A Google user,5,♥️
A Google user,5,excellent 👌
A Google user,5,very good apk to learn coding mimo👍
A Google user,5,easy to use and very easy to learn
A Google user,5,Mino is the best app to learn web programming
A Google user,4,Could you add a text to speech to the app that can read out the text of a lesson it can be optional but It would be good to have the text being read to yourself.
A Google user,5,"easy to use,very efficient and clear instructions"
A Google user,4,"The Mimo app itself is good, and the UI is user-friendly. The explanations could be improved a lot, and most of the content seems a bit too ""hand-holdy"", at least in the beginning. The reason I'm giving a lower star rating is that while the app offers a reasonably priced ""Pro"" subscription, you only get a sneak peek for the price in the Web version, where all meaningful content is locked behind ""Max"" - practicing on the phone is OK, but you need the web version for any real coding/learning."
A Google user,5,Wao this Mimo is good performance and good for practace etc i have play every day in my phone and chromebook i like this application i recommend this app is very good for you that how to make a professonal veb developr Thank youy
A Google user,5,it is easy to learn

A Google user,5,excellent
A Google user,5,It's very good
A Google user,5,Duolingo but better for aspiring developers! really nice and smooth 10/10
A Google user,5,fun and easy
A Google user,5,it's fun
A Google user,1,could be better
A Google user,3,"It's good. But don't bother if you want to learn react. The little coding environment they use formats the code in a ridiculous way that makes it very hard and time consuming to read, definitely needs a lot of work. Some of the practice lessons are bugged and don't accept the correct answer. Even when you use the 'Use Solution' button which generates the correct code for the question, (the app Devs' own code) it still won't work then you can't progress. Don't spend money on this like I did."
A Google user,5,Not bad
A Google user,1,About subscription is so noisy 🙄
A Google user,5,nice application. very easy to understand
A Google user,5,"only problem it gives you lives bro , whyyyyyyy"
A Google user,5,i think I am really obsessed

A Google user,5,Muito interessante. Estou gostando!
A Google user,5,You ve' got all the time you need
A Google user,5,"For Absolute Basics Of Any Programming Language 'Mimo' Is Best And Most 💪 Appropriate Application. Thanks for Your Services 💖, And I Have. Some Suggestions For Developer That You Should Add Some Methods To Regain Hearts. Maybe You Can Add Watch AD ( Advertisement ) And Regain One Heart Or Do Some Hard Code Then Get One Heart. You Can See This Type Of Features In Duolingo App."
A Google user,5,I'm research many apps all are good but it's outstanding app.I also recommend you to use it if you are student of computer science. Thank you
A Google user,5,The best that could have been existing. Its an excellent platform. Easy to learn from. Best for beginners ❤
A Google user,4,"Great for Beginners, Intermediate and Advanced coders"
A Google user,5,nice
A Google user,5,it's easy learning app
A Google user,1,They jumped on the AI band wagon. I use to recommend this to everyone and now can't. That along with seeing the reviews for subscriptions is just sad. You're better off using W3Schools or Free Code Camp
A Google user,5,"honestly, didn't expect much from this. but wow, I'm catching on pretty quick. they really break it down for you, so you can understand. definitely was made by a very knowledgeable teacher that knows how people learn. 10/10"
A Google user,5,best app to learn codings

A Google user,5,"Very user-friendly, easy to understand."
A Google user,4,"I had a very good experience, seems a very nice app, sadly I'm broke to pay for it 😔"
A Google user,5,well apps
A Google user,5,genial
A Google user,2,"It's a good way to learn to code but the time to wait for just one heart is just not it, most of the useful stuff is literally behind a pay wall. Why create an app that requires more waiting than learning, fix your app and maybe I will consider changing my review."
A Google user,5,"Relaxing app whilst learning to code, surprised how quick I am picking things up already. Love the little jingles as well, great app and really affordable for pro, will definitely get a subscription when I can!"
A Google user,5,This app is good for learn programming and very easy methods to learn and this is too easy
A Google user,5,Easy learning like child. There is no need for memory issues. It's like a game to teach
A Google user,4,"Great for learning effectively especially for a person with ADHD. Also I would like to suggest few features: 1) Read aloud:This can be something of a useful tool for people who has long sightedness, has ADHD or Dislexia or may be too tired to read. Perhaps, the main objective is,even with very low capacity,ability or energy users should still be able learn interactively and efficiently. 2) More language:More languages so that users with various coding goals can learn and not just web-devloper"
A Google user,5,good and nice
A Google user,5,"i love it good,for learning"
A Google user,5,Great for being introduced to software and programming skills 👌
A Google user,5,perfect
A Google user,5,yummy food recipes i have made a game that you cook food
A Google user,4,very very easy to understand and learn coding
A Google user,2,"I am glad with this app but the system of hearts I didn't like it because there are only 5 hearts and if you made a mistake then you will lose one and if all of them has gone then you have to wait for 5 to 6 hrs and even more then that . So,I would suggest that there shall be some changes need to made regarding this. Overall It is a great app for learning coding"
A Google user,5,i love coding on mimo
A Google user,1,"Says Coding App.. it's a stupid training app. At least get the title right. Wasted my time going through 10 questions, begging me to pay, and I still can't start coding. I already know how to code don't need to learn. What a waste of time!"
A Google user,5,Mast app for learning programming language
A Google user,5,The best app I've ever downloaded.
A Google user,4,"if only there was a short summary we can return to next to each lesson, otherwise it's perfect, thanks for your hard work."

A Google user,5,great for beginners like me!
A Google user,5,Best way to learn website building with HTML/CSS/JS.
A Google user,3,Wasn't clear this is a subscription app...
A Google user,4,"The Mimo app is good, and the UI is user-friendly. However, sometimes the explanations can be a bit confusing, so it would be helpful if they were made clearer. Also, it would be great to have a codepad within the app to practice coding skills directly. One issue I noticed is that on my tablet, the Mimo app works fine without needing the Pro version, but on the desktop browser, it asks me to buy the Pro version, otherwise Mimo doesn’t work without it."
A Google user,4,amazing 👏
A Google user,5,"it's like Duolingo, but for coding, it's really nice"
A Google user,5,so fun
A Google user,5,Add java and c language
A Google user,5,"This is very helpful app..overall it's very good app...but it lack languages like C, C++, java... I hope they include it soon."
A Google user,5,"Great for learning basic programming syntax, from frontend to backend."
A Google user,5,good
A Google user,1,atleast give the certificates for free after long days of hardwork just to pay and get that.
A Google user,5,This is very good app for learn

A Google user,5,👍👍
A Google user,4,I just started lesson. so far so good it is going smoothly
A Google user,1,"DO NOT PAY FOR PRO VERSION! You pay thinking that this initial purchase will unlock everything, but then they tell you that you need to use the computer, and when you log in from your computer they try to charge you for a different subscription called MAX for $300 in order to continue!! Overall, it's completely outrageous and makes no sense to be charged $370 in order to use your computer and phone, it feels like a scam! I wish they would've made pricing clear from the beginning!"
A Google user,5,Wonderful app ❤️

A Google user,1,This app doesn't give the option to choose the google account for payment . There's no answer in their help center about it. The app randomly selects the google account if you have multiple google accounts on your phone and there's no way to change it.
A Google user,5,nice 👍
A Google user,5,good

A Google user,5,Great app good learning experience you should give it a try 😁
A Google user,1,They make it hard to cancel your subscription so you'd pay for the extra months. It should be simple and through the mimo site.
A Google user,5,Only at the start but it is fantastic so far!
A Google user,1,"It feels great! However, both google and the advertisements for mimo mentioned this program containing courses for c#. Despite this, these courses were dropped entirely earlier this month. Very bad marketing to advertise a now redacted feature."
A Google user,5,honestly just started my 14 day free trial and it's amazing and I will make updates on my experience
A Google user,5,literally I can learn and code anywhere.. 👌🏻
A Google user,5,Please add c course as well pls pls pls

A Google user,4,"I've been using mimo for a week and so far it was great! i only hope there were more ways than spending coins or waiting for the time to pass to regain hearts, like duolingo for example offers additional quizzes where u can regain hearts"
A Google user,5,It is the best application from which we can learn coding easily in game only So I suggest you all to download it it is not a scam
A Google user,5,I just started using this app and it's been great since then. The app makes coding so easy to learn. Hope I will have the same experience till the end.

A Google user,5,wow
A Google user,2,Lame you have to pay 60$ for certificate
A Google user,4,Great apps for debutant
A Google user,5,It's prefect!
A Google user,5,"Great app, really simple and handy with phones. Been using since a week for learning python and already learned pretty much. it's great if you can't give much time to learning coding, rather than scrolling on phone or waiting at some place you can do something productive. it's really great!!!"
A Google user,5,Great app to learn basic coding
A Google user,5,it's really helpful.... thanks for the efforts made
A Google user,5,"Is the code being taught in OS, Mac, or linux?"
A Google user,5,"great for me, I find the platform brilliant & ADHD friendly"
A Google user,5,awesome🥰
A Google user,5,so nice and user friendly
A Google user,5,This is best app to learn coding or programming
A Google user,1,"Terrible these clowns after realizing the app isn't professional or accepted anywhere,they continue to try and charge my account? Please stop I used your cheesey free edition, please stop trying to steal my money losers . To your response,I wouldn't ask for any help ,I deleted your app and I don't want you to keep charging me for year subscription at $64.64 , honestly why have y'all tried changing me over 15 times ,please stop I don't want your service and the app sucks ,so find another pansy p,"
A Google user,4,Your app is good! I want that you will also add C++ programming language in your app
A Google user,3,ok
A Google user,5,nice platform to learn with fun
A Google user,5,Amazing app you shoud probably add C# C++ lua also there is a bug where the time goes negative and I will have to wait again to get my heart but still amazing app
A Google user,4,"You need add more react, typescript paths"
A Google user,5,owesome
A Google user,5,best for beginners
A Google user,5,"a very nice app, user friendly and it is very well made."
A Google user,5,it's just nice
A Google user,1,Don't have what I'm looking for
A Google user,5,This is the best coding app
A Google user,5,super
A Google user,4,"interactive and easy to manage. So far, have only use it for 10 minutes and I am learning."
A Google user,5,it's a good apk for learning
A Google user,5,Challenging and fun!
A Google user,5,great free coding app to start your journey it's really good at giving you a great start and helps you understand mistakes better.
A Google user,4,"Great for learning the basics. Not really a fan of the heart system because making mistakes is part of learning how code works... I also don't like how it has me do the same things over and over and over in the same lesson, like noo I just did that.. 😫 helped me realize how boring and menial CSS is. I enjoy JavaScript though, which I started learning on FreeCodeCamp while I use this Mimo app for practicing HTML/CSS. Wish there were more references in this app too..."
A Google user,5,This is coding without tears 😎
A Google user,5,Best programming app ever!
A Google user,4,good 💯
A Google user,5,very helpful. i might be able to learn how to create stuff I want and need one day.
A Google user,5,i just started! 🔥
A Google user,5,Great
A Google user,5,"I love this app . It is very easy to learn app and in simple language . But please other languages also like c ,c++ and Java."
A Google user,4,"The duolingo of coding. I wanted to learn the basics of Python and other coding for fun. It is very similar to duolingo. However, since it is coding, it seems like it would be more effective if I could type in the code myself rather than select options. Adding that in to the movile app would be really beneficial."
A Google user,5,Great for learning code
A Google user,5,"Haven't had enough time to judge, but all is good after using it for two days. I take it back after using it for more than ten days. This app is the best. The ads are justified. The lessons are so easy to understand(Might be because I did web development classes a while back). I actually wanna pay for the pro, too."
A Google user,1,🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡
A Google user,5,it's really good for students who want to become a programmer
A Google user,5,this is a good app for the beginners of coding
A Google user,5,I love this app so much. it makes understanding html easier.
A Google user,5,it's really easy and fun to learn with mimo😊✨✨❤️❤️❤️I love it!!!
A Google user,5,it is a great teaching app
A Google user,5,"A very well designed app, even the ads looks great"
A Google user,5,Good so far. Let's see if it's useful for more than just basic knowledge
A Google user,5,top
A Google user,1,Usless
A Google user,4,"good app, great price. could maybe be more transparent about how much work you can get free"
A Google user,5,Good app hshsh
A Google user,5,"I got my little brother to get it as he wishes to code games in the future, he sent me a link for a free trial to the pro version which he's now enjoying, but I've also got hooked after starting it and I had no interest in trying it. it's so bloody simple. the pro version pricing is more than acceptable and we'll probably being be getting it. an absolute gem of a teaching app. p.s in the half an hour I've used this, I've had 1 advert. 1! acceptable!"
A Google user,4,"The app is very helpful, on the whole it's very easy to use, very precise. It's also very fast paced. Above all, its free, it is a very nice way to utilize your time and learn a helpful skill that can possibly earn you some money in the future, as these skills are high in demand, and their demand will rise even more in the future. Again, I would say it's very nice and I would definitely recommend it. The only problem is tho, that it does promote ɭGʙʈ, so do keep that in mind."
A Google user,5,great
A Google user,5,its a great app overall but they could add a feature so you code also code while learning
A Google user,3,Good to practising..I m happy to learn here ..it's helps me lots of..

A Google user,5,easy learn
A Google user,4,I do misteks I need more hearts
A Google user,5,"Mimo is extremely enjoyable to use so far! Lessons are appropriately sized so it doesn't feel like too much information at once, and concepts are repeated several times in varying fashions. For me, these lessons seem to stick!"
A Google user,5,"very educational, helps me learn to code"
A Google user,5,Bestttt

A Google user,5,so far it's seems very informative and let's you learn at your own pace
A Google user,5,Amazing!
A Google user,5,"lm still new to this app, but l can say for sure it is a great app for learning to program in a nice, subtle way , l mean it is user-friendly to novice people and it allows you to learn in a slower, understandable way without losing interest. l can go all day about my experience, but all l can say is that it is a great app, and l recommend it to those who are into coding. Nice work from the team. Keep up the good work"
A Google user,4,"I can say this app is very wholesome! It really not only does help in building up skills but also lets us experience set of unique problems inorder to improve our analogical and thinking skills..I would definitely recommend this app to learn something new and definitely build up skills for your career..and the reason behind me giving 4 stars is due to lack of few languages like django,C,..etc., so I hope developers notice this review and work on this specific area inorder to help lot of people!"
A Google user,5,"The best app ever, I'm learning coding and having fun in the process. I love 😘"
A Google user,5,it's really great. the app just flows. I wish they could've made the lessons a little more challenging but other than that it's great.
A Google user,5,"it's a very good app, highly recommended. I don't know a single thing about coding but just in 10 minutes im getting better. if i will continue using this app until a month maybe i could master the coding. Great job developer."
A Google user,5,straight forward and user friendly!
A Google user,5,Nice learning experience 🥇
A Google user,4,😇
A Google user,3,"The ""pay to learn"" aspect is as annoying as the ads. There are similar apps with similar functionality without all the nagging. They should find a sponsorship to allow their app to be more inclusive and nag free."
A Google user,5,nice app n
A Google user,5,very good app for learn coding for me.
A Google user,5,"so easy to use, learning how to code here is like Duolingo learning new language"
A Google user,4,Really good app which teach you according to your level and believe me even if you're a beginner without any coding experience you' ll understand. Plus it shows you which profession you can embrace with each language and even have a tailored program for each profession for example if you want to be a stack developer it' ll select the languages you have to learn.
A Google user,5,good
A Google user,5,excellent
A Google user,4,"Interesting and easy to learn, I can say it's coding made easy."
A Google user,5,"The best app . to understand it with more detail then YouTube. plus, it's will test you during the course. Love it!"

A Google user,5,This is the best app i ever seen actually im 10 years old but now i know coding this is the most efficient way of learning
A Google user,5,it was a great application to learn coding
A Google user,3,"I found this app to be very helpful and informative. However, as a middle aged person, (with mental health issues), I would have preferred to have more chance to repeat and revise each atep and lesson. Don't judge me please I decided to cancel my subscription even though I was enjoying it, because I simply couldn't keep up. A great way to learn, but more practice time would be good. People learn in different ways."
A Google user,2,"I just did the complete html course. They don't even teach you important topics. Even If I completed the course and when I look at other HTML codes, I don't know half the things! I would not recommend this app to learn anything"
A Google user,5,really fun
A Google user,5,nice app to learn coding for beginners.
A Google user,5,It is the best app to learn coding. It can help everybody to learn coding. It is very easy to learn coding with this app.I love this app.
A Google user,4,The mimo site doesn't seem to be working. I'm trying to do the Unix Converter project and I need to do it on a computer but the site isn't working.
A Google user,5,Just discovered it today via YouTube. This a great game as I'm busy with Software Engineering Bootcamp. I can't stop playing it as am ex-Duolingo addict😅
A Google user,5,There's always room for improvement
A Google user,5,"Best for coding journey, specially for begging"
A Google user,5,Very interactive app
A Google user,5,perfect for learning
A Google user,1,I installed an android emulator just so I could learn in my pc without paying
A Google user,5,please include java
A Google user,5,good 👍
A Google user,5,best app
A Google user,5,Best app to learn programming
A Google user,5,Nice Apk for learning Programming
A Google user,5,Best for learning coding from scratch. Begginer friendly.
A Google user,5,"my favorite so far for learning and practicing my code as an IT student, TYSM I'LL PLAY A LOT I MEAN STUDY A LOT HAHA"
A Google user,3,it is very good platform to learn coding but we must have subscription to learn undisturbly but I don't have subscription ☹️
A Google user,5,really great learning tool
A Google user,1,I just want to learn python for a class I'm taking but it's trying to make me learn all sorts of other languages first
A Google user,5,"I was thinking that, coding is harder than anything to start, but by the grace of Allah I will know how to code Soon with Mimo."
A Google user,5,Awesome. Clear instructions with reviews.
A Google user,5,Fun and easy way to learning g code! Enjoyable 15 min. of my day!
A Google user,5,so far so good 10 min in
A Google user,4,good and very educational app for beginners.
A Google user,3,"so far I'm enjoyingthe app its gr8, ill2see what i can do about the other 2 stars as time passes by."
A Google user,4,"It's a great app, but there's a lot of things it could improve and a lot of bugs to work on. The only thing I think they should add is something to make us redo the lessons we already did, and to count points to the rank when redoing these lesson."
A Google user,1,the number of hearts needs to be increased because one gets only some time in a day to practice as a beingnner I would say it's frustrating to wait for another heart to solve the exercises makes me uninstall the app bad experience with mimo.
A Google user,5,Nice
A Google user,5,super easy to learn
A Google user,5,fun and easy to learn
A Google user,5,Nice.
A Google user,5,Best learning app for system languages
A Google user,5,Great for learning the basics.
A Google user,1,This app repeat more and more you offline
A Google user,4,"Good app, the only letdown for me is when you do a code challenge and you get all the code correct but tells you it's wrong because your print statement had a full stop on the end, (which is grammatical correct by the way) it's like writing a print statement asking what is your age? And it's says it's wrong because it has a question mark at the end. Losing a heart for that is just ridiculous needs to be changed. But overall I like the app a lot."
A Google user,5,Best Learning App 🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥
A Google user,5,it's teaches great 😍✨🍃🦋 i love it
A Google user,5,Good.
A Google user,5,"I did a web design class my senior year, and I really like that it is taught exactly the same way my teacher taught my class. super easy to follow, excited to learn more and get back into coding!"
A Google user,4,👌
A Google user,5,its good for beginners and proo
A Google user,5,Easy to learn with interesting step by step tutorials.
A Google user,5,I'm so glad to have downloaded this app🤩🤩. Best app ever to learn programming
A Google user,5,so simple and fun 🥰🥰🥰🥰
A Google user,5,I've found mimo a comprehensive guide to coding. lm not a pro user but I think being pro can be more helpful and reliable
A Google user,5,It is a fantastic app for people who want to learn coding. It is perfect if you want to improve in coding.
A Google user,3,App is great but I'm having issues with online payments.i already linked my payment method to my Google account Why can't I select that payment method when I use mimo
A Google user,5,ótimo
A Google user,4,Free practice that takes 15 minutes. You're either right or wrong but gives you a chance to fix it. No free trial needed to practice. Just registration. You can exit out of the pricing option and get into practicing. I haven't gotten past level 3 so not sure when they'll require a purchase.
A Google user,4,When we press continue then the code which appears on the white screen of the browser should be made black. It looks very sharp to the eyes when we press continue.
A Google user,5,It's good for me as a beginner
A Google user,5,"Very good application to learn Web development, Html, CSS and JS"
A Google user,5,Not Bad
A Google user,5,very nice and not to fast paced unlike my classes. it's perfect for a beginer like me.
A Google user,5,it's helpful and well structured
A Google user,5,Nice!
A Google user,5,"seems pretty good, I am new though and will update if the app loses its' touch. const writtenDate = ""9/15/2024"";"
A Google user,5,so far this app is pretty good it's taught me a lot about web coding unfortunately I didn't click Python cuz when I put what I'm learning now to a python coding app that's not like working but it's still pretty good
A Google user,5,This is really a cool way to learn!
A Google user,2,very much educative
A Google user,5,this app is like a game and best for basic coding in free
A Google user,5,this is a very useful technology for understand html and full stack developer course thankyou....
A Google user,5,it is good aap
A Google user,1,Money trap....
A Google user,5,super developer learning app
A Google user,5,I literally learnt EVERTHING about coding in this app thank you so much for this amazing app. One day I had downloaded another coding app and I made a HUGE html code and my father was very very very proud of me and he said that one day I will be like Elon Musk
A Google user,5,this might help me
A Google user,5,awesome
A Google user,5,great app for beginners
A Google user,5,这个应用程序真的非常非常好而且有用。我很高兴拥有它☺️
A Google user,4,they are going back level
A Google user,5,"So far so good, I can easily to understand programming. I'm learn from zero and the method is working."

A Google user,5,excellent 👌
A Google user,5,good
A Google user,4,Super
A Google user,5,very good
A Google user,5,very nice explanation and systematic content organisation
A Google user,5,it's azome
A Google user,5,nice and effective learning
A Google user,5,Well structured for learning as a beginner
A Google user,1,"Wouldn't allow me to complete level a rt the start of the bot, only fail no option to actually correct code"
A Google user,5,I saw people that said we do not rate applications and games usually but to be honest I am someone never rate anything. I really loved Mimo and I support this application and I wish by their help one day I learn some coding languages and be an amazing developer. This application can be even better in new updates if they add more languages like Lua (Since people use it for Roblox) and C# and WordPress. Also Mimo teach Java and Python amazing but they need to focus on Python as great as Java.
A Google user,5,this is probably the only reason I know how to code
A Google user,4,I'm actually enjoying learning code so far
A Google user,5,very useful and easy to learn
A Google user,1,"This app asks to get started or already have an account. I have no account, so I hit get started, and I click the links I click, but it just gives me suggestions, it doesn't let me start, or give me the option to set up an account..... Edit I got in through Gmail, just to find a 14 day free trial offer. Free is not a trial offer. That's just another false advertisement in Google play. If there are free and paid versions, put them in separate apps that could be linked later if one wants to pay."
A Google user,5,I just started to learn coding and programming and this application is too helpful and useful and interactive. awesome experience ❤️
A Google user,5,"I absolutely love this app so far. The lessons are easy to learn and have a nice smooth progress to them. I also love the humor in the text example of the website. This app is quite addictive and fun and not to mention I am learning to code all at the same time, great job guys!"
A Google user,5,Excellent to learn
A Google user,5,easy to follow fs🩷

A Google user,5,THIS APP VERY HELPFUL
A Google user,5,👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
A Google user,5,I like this app! it's so inspiring 👏
A Google user,5,"With some education in programming going back years, forgetting a majority, this app offers those with little to no experience the perfect platform. The Mimo app, you can easily recap, or start from nothing and catch on quickly. Just time, patience, and taking it step-by-step you will be surprised at how quickly you begin to understand the language & the operations. What is so amazing about this unique app, is that whether you're 9 or a 90yr old, the app makes it easy for anyone. 9 ⭐s out of 10!"
A Google user,5,i learn alot plus enjoy coding more
A Google user,5,just take regular classes for being a professional in coding
A Google user,4,very nice... 👍😁
A Google user,5,it is a good step by step guide for full begginers

A Google user,5,Amazing Application
A Google user,4,good but it need to have voice button
A Google user,5,great app for begginer program
A Google user,4,Its a great way to learn how to code i just wish that when you lose a heart you could get another one back like you would with Duolingo where you can learn over mistakes you made to get a life back. Overall a great app. :)
A Google user,4,I find it to be a great platform for learning Python. I like how easy it is to learn on my breaks at work.
A Google user,5,very good app
A Google user,3,"very,! very! nice app for coding"
